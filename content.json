It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version, Detectron, and it originates from Mask R-CNN. Table detection is a crucial step in many document analysis applications as tables are used for presenting essential information to the reader in a structured manner. It is a hard problem due to varying layouts and encodings of the tables. Researchers have proposed numerous techniques for table detection based on layout analysis of documents. Most of these techniques fail to generalize because they rely on hand engineered features which are not robust to layout variations. In this post, we propose a detectron2 based method for table detection. Why use detectron2? It is powered by the PyTorch deep learning framework. It Include more features such as panoptic segmentation, Densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, PointRend, DeepLab, etc. It can be used as a library to support different projects on top of it. It trains very faster. The Models can be exported to torchscript format or caffe2 format for deployment. How to implement?The implemented CODE contains THREE parts: Create custom COCO dataset You can run the voc2coco.py script to generate a COCO data formatted JSON file. 1python voc2coco.py ./dataset/annotations ./dataset/coco/output.json Then you can run the following Jupyter notebook to visualize the coco annotations.

The method uses ‘Soft-Masked BERT’ is general, and it may be employed in other language detection-correction problems not just focusing on CSC (Chinese Spelling error Correction) domain as it’s proposed in the original paper. The Architecture of Soft-Masked BERTSoft-Masked BERT is composed of a detection network based on Bi-GRU and a correction network based on BERT. The detection network predicts the probabilities of errors and the correction network predicts the probabilities of error corrections, while the former passes its prediction results to the latter using soft masking. The Model first creates an embedding for each character in the input sentence, referred to as input embedding. Next, it takes the sequence of embeddings as input and outputs the probabilities of errors for the sequence of characters (embeddings) using the detection network. After that it calculates the weighted sum of the input embeddings and [MASK] embeddings weighted by the error probabilities. The calculated embeddings mask the likely errors in the sequence in a soft way. Then it takes the sequence of soft-masked embeddings as input and outputs the probabilities of error corrections using the correction network, which is a BERT model whose final layer consists of a softmax function for all characters. There is also a residual connection between the input embeddings and the embeddings at the final layer.

It has caused a stir in the Machine Learning community by presenting state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of NLP tasks, including Question Answering, Natural Language Inference, and others. BERT’s key technical innovation is applying the bidirectional training of Transformer, a popular attention model, to language modelling. This is in contrast to previous efforts which looked at a text sequence either from left to right or combined left-to-right and right-to-left training. The results show that a language model which is bidirectionally trained can have a deeper sense of language context and flow than single-direction language models. BERT makes use of Transformer, an attention mechanism that learns contextual relations between words (or sub-words) in a text. Transformer includes two separate mechanisms — an encoder that reads the text input and a decoder that produces a prediction for the task. As opposed to directional models, which read the text input sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left), the Transformer encoder reads the entire sequence of words at once. Therefore it is considered bidirectional, though it would be more accurate to say that it’s non-directional. This characteristic allows the model to learn the context of a word based on all of its surroundings (left and right of the word).

It then compares all permutations (insertions, deletions, replacements, and transpositions) to known words in a word frequency list. Those words that are found more often in the frequency list are more likely the correct results. The correction(A) function tries to choose the most likely spelling correction for A. There is no way to know for sure (for example, should “lates” be corrected to “late” or “latest” or “lattes” or …?), which suggests we use probabilities. We are trying to find the correction B, out of all possible candidate corrections, that maximizes the probability that B is the intended correction, given the original word A.

Sometimes, when you find a fantastic GitHub repository which share a pre-trained model on a framework which you are not familiar with. For example, you are an expert PyTorch deep learning code developer, meanwhile you find a great code with its pre-trained model on MXNet; and you want to modify this model according to your needs. Thus, deep learning model conversion tools are extremely needed. As each framework has its own structure, converting a model between two different frameworks requires a great knowledge of both of them. However, There are many fantastic model conversion tools such as ONNX, MMdnn, and etc. for converting and visualizing deep models between a wide collection of frameworks. Model Convertors ONNX ONNX is an effort to unify converters for neural networks in order to bring some sanity to the NN world. Released by Facebook and Microsoft. MMdnn MMdnn (Model Management Deep Neural Network) is supported by Microsoft, By using MMdnn, one can convert each model from the origin framework to a standard Intermediate Representation (IR), and then convert the IR format to the target framework structure. It can convert models between CaffeEmit, CNTK, CoreML, Keras, MXNet, ONNX, PyTorch and TensorFlow. PyTorch convertor PyTorch convertor can convert models to PyTorch model. TensorFlow convertor TensorFlow convertor can convert models to TensorFlow model. Keras convertor Keras convertor can convert models to Keras model. MXNet convertor MXNet convertor can convert models to MXNet model. Caffe convertor Caffe convertor can convert models to Caffe model. Caffe2 convertor Caffe2 convertor can convert models to Caffe2 model. CNTK convertor CNTK convertor can convert models to CNTK model. Theano/Lasagne convertor Theano/Lasagne convertor can convert models to Theano/Lasagne model. Darknet convertor Darknet convertor can convert models to Darknet model. Torch convertor Torch convertor can convert models to Torch model. Neon convertor Neon convertor can convert models to Neon model. CoreML convertor CoreML convertor can convert models to coreML model. Paddle convertor Paddle convertor can convert models to Paddle model. Chainer convertor Chainer convertor can convert models to Chainer model. A Demo of Model Convertion from MXNet to PyTorch Here is an appropriate example to convert the Full ImageNet pre-trained model from MXNet to PyTorch via MMdnn convertor. ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images. Since 2010, the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) is a competition where research teams evaluate their algorithms on the given data set, and compete to achieve higher accuracy on several visual recognition tasks. A common reason to train a network on ImageNet data is to use it for transfer learning (including feature extraction or fine-tuning other models). Having a pre-trained model which is trained on such a huge training data set (i.e., full ImageNet), would be a really valuable network. It can speed up the convergence early in the training phase, and also improves the target task accuracy in some scenarios.

Stephen Cheng Intro Automatic clustering algorithms are algorithms that can perform clustering without prior knowledge of data sets, and determine the optimal number of clusters even in the presence of noise and outlier points. Silhouette Analysis Silhouette analysis can be used to study the separation distance between the resulting clusters. The silhouette plot displays a measure of how close each point in one cluster is to points in the neighboring clusters. The silhouette score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from −1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters. Thus silhouette analysis can be used to choose an optimal number for clusters automatically. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Hierarchical clustering algorithms fall into 2 branches: top-down or bottom-up. Bottom-up algorithms treat each data point as a single cluster at the outset and then successively merge (or agglomerate) pairs of clusters until all clusters have been merged into a single cluster that contains all data points. Bottom-up hierarchical clustering is therefore called hierarchical agglomerative clustering or HAC. This hierarchy of clusters is represented as a tree (or dendrogram). The root of the tree is the unique cluster that gathers all the samples, the leaves being the clusters with only one sample. The Steps of Hierarchical clustering: We start by treating each data point as a single cluster i.e. if there are N data points in our dataset then we have N clusters. We then select a distance metric that measures the distance between two clusters. As an example, we will use average linkage which defines the distance between two clusters to be the average distance between data points in the first cluster and data points in the second cluster. On each iteration, two clusters are combined into one. The two clusters to be combined are selected as those with the smallest average linkage. I.e. according to our selected distance metric, these two clusters have the smallest distance between each other and therefore are the most similar and should be combined. Step 2 is repeated until we reach the root of the tree that one cluster contains all data points. In this way we can select how many clusters we want in the end simply by choosing when to stop combining the clusters i.e. when we stop building the tree! Automatic ClusteringSince hierarchical clustering does not require us to specify the number of clusters and we can even select which number of clusters looks best since we are building a tree. Here we use the silhouette score to help us determine choosing the optimal number of clusters for clustering task automatically. An example of auto-clustering with silhouette analysis on agglomerative hierarchical clustering is shown as follows. 12345678import pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCAfrom sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClusteringfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, normalizefrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_scoreimport scipy.cluster.hierarchy as shc Load and clean the data: 1234567X = pd.read_csv('customer_info.csv')# Dropping the CUST_ID column from the dataX = X.drop('CUST_ID', axis = 1)# Handling the missing valuesX.fillna(method ='ffill', inplace = True) Preprocess the data: 12345678910# Scaling the data so that all the features become comparablescaler = StandardScaler()X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)# Normalizing the data so that the data approximately # follows a Gaussian distributionX_normalized = normalize(X_scaled)# Converting the numpy array into a pandas DataFrameX_normalized = pd.DataFrame(X_normalized) Reduce the dimensionality: 1234pca = PCA(n_components = 2)X_new = pca.fit_transform(X_normalized)df_new = pd.DataFrame(X_new)df_new.columns = ['P1', 'P2'] Visualize the dendograms: 123plt.figure(figsize =(8, 8))plt.title('Visualising Clustering')Dendrogram = shc.dendrogram((shc.linkage(df_new, method ='ward'))) Evaluate the clustering models: 123456789101112131415161718k = range(2,10)ac_list = [AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters = i) for i in k]# Appending the silhouette scoressilhouette_scores = &#123;&#125;silhouette_scores.fromkeys(k)for i,j in enumerate(k): silhouette_scores[j] = silhouette_score(df_new, ac_list[i].fit_predict(df_new))# Plottingy = list(silhouette_scores.values())plt.bar(k, y)plt.xlabel('Number of clusters', fontsize = 20)plt.ylabel('S(i)', fontsize = 20)plt.show() From the result above, we can conclude that 3 clusters obtain the highest silhouette score so the optimal number of clusters is 3 in this case.

It supports object detection and it’s built in Python, using TensorFlow. The code is open source and available on GitHub. Detecting Objects with a Pre-trained ModelThe first thing is being familiarized with the Luminoth CLI tool, that is, the tool that you interact with using the lumi command. This is the main gate to Luminoth, allowing you to train new models, evaluate them, use them for predictions, manage the checkpoints and more. If we want Luminoth to predict the objects present in one of pictures (image.jpg). The way to do that is by running the following command: 1lumi predict image.jpg The result will be like this: 123Found 1 files to predict.Neither checkpoint not config specified, assuming `accurate`.Checkpoint not found. Check remote repository? [y/N]: Since you didn’t tell Luminoth what an “object” is for you, nor have taught it how to recognize said objects. So one way to do this is to use a pre-trained model that has been trained to detect popular types of objects. E.g., it can be a model trained with COCO dataset or Pascal VOC. What’s more, each pre-trained model might be associated with a different algorithm. The checkpoints correspond to the weights of a particular model (Faster R-CNN or SSD), trained with a particular dataset. The case of “accurate” is just a label for a particular Deep Learning model underneath, here, Faster R-CNN, trained with images from the COCO dataset. After the checkpoint download, with these commands we can output everything (a resulting image and a json file) to a preds directory: 12mkdir predslumi predict image.jpg -f preds/objects.json -d preds/ Exploring the Pre-trained CheckpointsFirst, run the lumi checkpoint refresh command, so Luminoth knows about the checkpoints that it has available for download. After refreshing the local index, you can list the available checkpoints running lumi checkpoint list: 123456================================================================================| id | name | alias | source | status |================================================================================| e1c2565b51e9 | Faster R-CNN w/COCO | accurate | remote | DOWNLOADED || aad6912e94d9 | SSD w/Pascal VOC | fast | remote | NOT_DOWNLOADED |================================================================================ Here, you can see the “accurate” checkpoint and another “fast” checkpoint that is the SSD model trained with Pascal VOC dataset. Let’s get some information about the “accurate” checkpoint by the following command: 1lumi checkpoint info e1c2565b51e9 or 1lumi checkpoint info accurate If getting predictions for an image or video using a specific checkpoint (e.g., fast) you can do so by using the –checkpoint parameter: 1lumi predict img.jpg --checkpoint fast -f preds/objects.json -d preds/ Playing Around with the Built-in InterfaceLuminoth includes a simple web frontend so you can play around with detected objects in images using different thresholds. To launch this, simply type lumi server web and then open your browser at http://localhost:5000. If you are running on an external VM, you can do lumi server web –host 0.0.0.0 –port to open in a custom port. Building Custom datasetIn order to use a custom dataset, we must first transform whatever format your data is in, to TFRecords files (one for each split — train, val, test). Luminoth reads datasets natively only in TensorFlow’s TFRecords format. This is a binary format that will let Luminoth consume the data very efficiently. Fortunately, Luminoth provides several CLI tools for transforming popular dataset format (such as Pascal VOC, ImageNet, COCO, CSV, etc.) into TFRecords. We should start by downloading the annotation files (this and this, for train) and the class description file. After we get the class-descriptions-boxable.csv file, we can go over all the classes available in the OpenImages dataset and see which ones are related to traffic dataset. The following were hand-picked after examining the full file: 12345678/m/015qff,Traffic light/m/0199g,Bicycle/m/01bjv,Bus/m/01g317,Person/m/04_sv,Motorcycle/m/07r04,Truck/m/0h2r6,Van/m/0k4j,Car Luminoth includes a dataset reader that can take OpenImages format, the dataset reader expects a particular directory layout so it knows where the files are located. In this case, files corresponding to the examples must be in a folder named like their split (train, test, …). So, you should have the following: 12345.├── class-descriptions-boxable.csv└── train ├── train-annotations-bbox.csv └── train-annotations-human-imagelabels-boxable.csv Then run the following command: 1234567lumi dataset transform \\ --type openimages \\ --data-dir . \\ --output-dir ./out \\ --split train \\ --class-examples 100 \\ --only-classes=/m/015qff,/m/0199g,/m/01bjv,/m/01g317,/m/04_sv,/m/07r04,/m/0h2r6,/m/0k4j This will generate TFRecord file for the train split: 12345678910INFO:tensorflow:Saved 360 records to \"./out/train.tfrecords\"INFO:tensorflow:Composition per class (train):INFO:tensorflow: Person (/m/01g317): 380INFO:tensorflow: Car (/m/0k4j): 255INFO:tensorflow: Bicycle (/m/0199g): 126INFO:tensorflow: Bus (/m/01bjv): 106INFO:tensorflow: Traffic light (/m/015qff): 105INFO:tensorflow: Truck (/m/07r04): 101INFO:tensorflow: Van (/m/0h2r6): 100INFO:tensorflow: Motorcycle (/m/04_sv): 100 Training the ModelTraining orchestration, including the model to be used, the dataset location and training schedule, is specified in a YAML config file. This file will be consumed by Luminoth and merged to the default configuration, to start the training session. You can see a minimal config file example in sample_config.yml. This file illustrates the entries you’ll most probably need to modify, which are: 1) train.run_name: the run name for the training session, used to identify it.2) train.job_dir: directory in which both model checkpoints and summaries (for TensorBoard consumption) will be saved. The actual files will be stored under /.3) dataset.dir: directory from which to read the TFRecord files.4) model.type: model to use for object detection (fasterrcnn, or ssd).5) network.num_classes: number of classes to predict (depends on your dataset). For looking at all the possible configuration options, mostly related to the model itself, you can check the base_config.yml file. Building the config file for the datasetProbably the most important setting for training is the learning rate. You will most likely want to tune this depending on your dataset, and you can do it via the train.learning_rate setting in the configuration. For example, this would be a good setting for training on the full COCO dataset: 1234learning_rate: decay_method: piecewise_constant boundaries: [250000, 450000, 600000] values: [0.0003, 0.0001, 0.00003, 0.00001] To get to this, you will need to run some experiments and see what works best. 12345678910111213141516171819train: # Run name for the training session. run_name: traffic job_dir: &lt;change this directory&gt; learning_rate: decay_method: piecewise_constant # Custom dataset for Luminoth Tutorial boundaries: [90000, 160000, 250000] values: [0.0003, 0.0001, 0.00003, 0.00001]dataset: type: object_detection dir: &lt;directory with your dataset&gt;model: type: fasterrcnn network: num_classes: 8 anchors: # Add one more scale to be better at detecting small objects scales: [0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2] Running the trainingAssuming you already have both your dataset (TFRecords) and the config file ready, you can start your training session by running the command as follows: 1lumi train -c config.yml You can use the -o option to override any configuration option using dot notation (e.g. -o model.rpn.proposals.nms_threshold=0.8). If you are using a CUDA-based GPU, you can select the GPU to use by setting the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable. Storing checkpoints (partial weights)As the training progresses, Luminoth will periodically save a checkpoint with the current weights of the model. The files will be output in your / folder. By default, they will be saved every 600 seconds of training, but you can configure this with the train.save_checkpoint_secs setting in your config file. The default is to only store the latest checkpoint (that is, when a checkpoint is generated, the previous checkpoint gets deleted) in order to conserve storage. Evaluating ModelsGenerally, datasets (like OpenImages, which we just used) provide “splits”. The “train” split is the largest, and the one from which the model actually does the learning. Then, you have the “validation” (or “val”) split, which consists of different images, in which you can draw metrics of your model’s performance, in order to better tune your hyperparameters. Finally, a “test” split is provided in order to conduct the final evaluation of how your model would perform in the real world once it is trained. Building a validation datasetLet’s start by building TFRecords from the validation split of OpenImages. For this, we can download the files with the annotations and use the same lumi dataset transform that we used to build our training data. In your dataset folder (where the class-descriptions-boxable.csv is located), run the following commands: 123mkdir validationwget -P validation https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/2018_04/validation/validation-annotations-bbox.csvwget -P validation https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/2018_04/validation/validation-annotations-human-imagelabels-boxable.csv After the downloads finish, we can build the TFRecords with the following: 1234567lumi dataset transform \\ --type openimages \\ --data-dir . \\ --output-dir ./out \\ --split validation \\ --class-examples 100 \\ --only-classes=/m/015qff,/m/0199g,/m/01bjv,/m/01g317,/m/04_sv,/m/07r04,/m/0h2r6,/m/0k4j The lumi eval commandIn Luminoth, lumi eval will make a run through your chosen dataset split (ie. validation or test), and run the model through every image, and then compute metrics like loss and mAP. If you are lucky and happen to have more than one GPU in your machine, it is advisable to run both train and eval at the same time. Start by running the evaluation: 1lumi eval --split validation -c custom.yml The mAP metricsMean Average Precision (mAP) is the metric commonly used to evaluate object detection task. It computes how well your classifier works across all classes, mAP will be a number between 0 and 1, and the higher the better. Moreover, it can be calculated across different IoU (Intersection over Union) thresholds. For example, Pascal VOC challenge metric uses 0.5 as threshold (notation mAP@0.5), and COCO dataset uses mAP at different thresholds and averages them all out (notation mAP@[0.5:0.95]). Luminoth will print out several of these metrics, specifying the thresholds that were used under this notation. Using TensorBoard for VisualizingTensorBoard is a very good tool for this, allowing you to see plenty of plots with the training related metrics. By default, Luminoth writes TensorBoard summaries during training, so you can leverage this tool without any effort: 1tensorboard --logdir &lt;job_dir&gt;/&lt;run_name&gt; If you are running from an external VM, make sure to use --host 0.0.0.0 and --port if you need other one than the default 6006. What to look forFirst, go to the “Scalars” tab. You are going to see several tags. validation_lossesHere, you will get the same loss values that Luminoth computes for the train, but for the chosen dataset split (validation, in this case). As in the case of train, you should mostly look at validation_losses/no_reg_loss. These will be the mAP metrics that will help you judge how well your model perform: The mAP values refer to the entire dataset split, so it will not jump around as much as other metrics. Manually inspecting with lumi server webYou can also use lumi server web command that we have seen before and try your partially trained model in a bunch of novel images. For this, you can launch it with a config file like: 1lumi server web -c config.yml Here you can also use –host and –port options. Creating and Sharing Your Own CheckpointsCreating a checkpointWe can create checkpoints and set some metadata like name, alias, etc. This time, we are going to create the checkpoint for our traffic model: 1234lumi checkpoint create \\ config.yml \\ -e name=\"OpenImages Traffic\" \\ -e alias=traffic You can verify that you do indeed have the checkpoint when running lumi checkpoint list, which should get you an output similar to this: 1234567================================================================================| id | name | alias | source | status |================================================================================| e1c2565b51e9 | Faster R-CNN w/COCO | accurate | remote | DOWNLOADED || aad6912e94d9 | SSD w/Pascal VOC | fast | remote | DOWNLOADED || cb0e5d92a854 | OpenImages Traffic | traffic | local | LOCAL |================================================================================ Moreover, if you inspect the ~/.luminoth/checkpoints/ folder, you will see that now you have a folder that corresponds to your newly created checkpoint. Inside this folder are the actual weights of the model, plus some metadata and the configuration file that was used during training. Sharing checkpointsSimply run lumi checkpoint export cb0e5d92a854. You will get a file named cb0e5d92a854.tar in your current directory, which you can easily share to somebody else. By running lumi checkpoint import cb0e5d92a854.tar, the checkpoint will be listed locally. Using Luminoth with PythonCalling Luminoth from your Python app is very straightforward. 123456789101112131415from luminoth import Detector, read_image, vis_objectsimage = read_image('traffic-image.png')# If no checkpoint specified, will assume `accurate` by default.

In MongoDB, records are documents which behave a lot like JSON objects in JavaScript. Values in documents can be looked up by their field’s key. Documents can have some fields/keys and not others, which makes Mongo extremely flexible. This is much different than SQL databases like MySQL, where fields correspond to columns in a table and individual records correspond to rows. Install and Run MongoDB with Homebrew Make sure Homebrew already installed on Mac (Homebrew is a package manager for the Mac – it makes installing most open source software).

The new data sets can have a fraction of the columns as well as rows, which are generally hyper-parameters in a bagging model. Taking row and column fractions less than 1 helps in making robust models, less prone to overfitting. 2) Build Multiple Classifiers Classifiers are built on each data set. Generally the same classifier is modeled on each dataset and predictions are made. 3) Combine Classifiers The predictions of all the classifiers are combined using a mean, median or mode value depending on the problem at hand. The combined values are generally more robust than a single model. Note that, here the number of models built is not a hyper-parameters. Higher number of models are always better or may give similar performance than lower numbers.

Bias means, ‘how much on an average are the predicted values different from the actual value.’ Variance means, ‘how different will the predictions of the model be at the same point if different samples are taken from the same population’. You build a small tree and you will get a model with low variance and high bias. How do you manage to balance the trade off between bias and variance ? Normally, as you increase the complexity of your model, you will see a reduction in prediction error due to lower bias in the model. As you continue to make your model more complex, you end up over-fitting your model and your model will start suffering from high variance. A champion model should maintain a balance between these two types of errors. This is known as the trade-off management of bias-variance errors.

If there is no limit set of a decision tree, it will give you 100% accuracy on training set because in the worse case it will end up making 1 leaf for each observation. Thus, preventing overfitting is pivotal while modeling a decision tree and it can be done in 2 ways: 1) Setting constraints on tree size.2) Tree pruning. Let’s discuss both of these briefly. Setting Constraints on Tree SizeThis can be done by using various parameters which are used to define a tree. First, let‘s look at the general structure of a decision tree. The parameters used for defining a tree are further explained below. The parameters described below are irrespective of tool. It is important to understand the role of parameters used in tree modeling. These parameters are available in R &amp; Python. Minimum samples for a node split 1) Defines the minimum number of samples (or observations) which are required in a node to be considered for splitting.2) Used to control over-fitting. Higher values prevent a model from learning relations which might be highly specific to the particular sample selected for a tree.3) Too high values can lead to under-fitting hence, it should be tuned using CV. Minimum samples for a terminal node (leaf) 1) Defines the minimum samples (or observations) required in a terminal node or leaf.2) Used to control over-fitting similar to min_samples_split.3) Generally lower values should be chosen for imbalanced class problems because the regions in which the minority class will be in majority will be very small. Maximum depth of tree (vertical depth) 1) The maximum depth of a tree.2) Used to control over-fitting as higher depth will allow model to learn relations very specific to a particular sample.3) Should be tuned using CV. Maximum number of terminal nodes 1) The maximum number of terminal nodes or leaves in a tree.2) Can be defined in place of max_depth. Since binary trees are created, a depth of ‘n’ would produce a maximum of 2^n leaves. Maximum features to consider for split 1) The number of features to consider while searching for a best split. These will be randomly selected.2) As a thumb-rule, square root of the total number of features works great but we should check up to 30-40% of the total number of features.3) Higher values can lead to over-fitting but depends on case to case. Tree PruningAs discussed earlier, the technique of setting constraint is a greedy-approach. In other words, it will check for the best split instantaneously and move forward until one of the specified stopping condition is reached. Let’s consider the following case when you’re driving. There are 2 lanes: 1) A lane with cars moving at 80km/h.2) A lane with trucks moving at 30km/h. At this instant, you are the yellow car and you have 2 choices: 1) Take a left and overtake the other 2 cars quickly.2) Keep moving in the present lane. Let’s analyze these choice. In the former choice, you’ll immediately overtake the car ahead and reach behind the truck and start moving at 30 km/h, looking for an opportunity to move back right. All cars originally behind you move ahead in the meanwhile. This would be the optimum choice if your objective is to maximize the distance covered in next say 10 seconds. In the later choice, you sale through at same speed, cross trucks and then overtake maybe depending on situation ahead. Greedy you! This is exactly the difference between normal decision tree &amp; pruning. A decision tree with constraints won’t see the truck ahead and adopt a greedy approach by taking a left. On the other hand if we use pruning, we in effect look at a few steps ahead and make a choice. How to prune? So we know pruning is better. But how to implement it in decision tree? The idea is simple. 1) We first make the decision tree to a large depth.2) Then we start at the bottom and start removing leaves which are giving us negative returns when compared from the top.3) Suppose a split is giving us a gain of say -10 (loss of 10) and then the next split on that gives us a gain of 20. A simple decision tree will stop at step 1 but in pruning, we will see that the overall gain is +10 and keep both leaves. Note Note that sklearn’s decision tree classifier does not currently support pruning. Advanced packages like xgboost have adopted tree pruning in their implementation. But the library rpart in R, provides a function to prune. Good for R users!","categories":[{"name":"Machine-Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Tree","slug":"Tree","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Tree/"},{"name":"Overfitting","slug":"Overfitting","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Overfitting/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"Merge Sort","slug":"MergeSort","date":"2018-05-19T04:23:47.000Z","updated":"2023-11-30T19:56:27.098Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/05/19/MergeSort/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2018/05/19/MergeSort/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroIn computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. DefinitionConceptually, a merge sort works as follows: 1) Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted). 2) Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.

This means that decision trees are typically drawn upside down such that leaves are the bottom &amp; roots are the tops (shown below). Both the trees work almost similar to each other, let’s look at the primary differences &amp; similarity between classification and regression trees: 1) Regression trees are used when dependent variable is continuous. Classification trees are used when dependent variable is categorical. 2) In case of regression tree, the value obtained by terminal nodes in the training data is the mean response of observation falling in that region. Thus, if an unseen data observation falls in that region, we’ll make its prediction with mean value. 3) In case of classification tree, the value (class) obtained by terminal node in the training data is the mode of observations falling in that region. Thus, if an unseen data observation falls in that region, we’ll make its prediction with mode value. 4) Both the trees divide the predictor space (independent variables) into distinct and non-overlapping regions. For the sake of simplicity, you can think of these regions as high dimensional boxes or boxes. 5) Both the trees follow a top-down greedy approach known as recursive binary splitting. We call it as ‘top-down’ because it begins from the top of tree when all the observations are available in a single region and successively splits the predictor space into two new branches down the tree. It is known as ‘greedy’ because, the algorithm cares (looks for best variable available) about only the current split, and not about future splits which will lead to a better tree. 6) This splitting process is continued until a user defined stopping criteria is reached. For example: we can tell the algorithm to stop once the number of observations per node becomes less than 50. 7) In both the cases, the splitting process results in fully grown trees until the stopping criteria is reached. But, the fully grown tree is likely to overfit data, leading to poor accuracy on unseen data. This bring ‘pruning’. Pruning is one of the technique used tackle overfitting.","categories":[{"name":"Machine-Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Machine-Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Machine-Learning/"},{"name":"Regression","slug":"Regression","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Regression/"},{"name":"Classification","slug":"Classification","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Classification/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"Levenshtein Distance","slug":"LevenshteinDistance","date":"2018-04-18T22:09:03.000Z","updated":"2023-11-30T19:56:31.976Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/04/18/LevenshteinDistance/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2018/04/18/LevenshteinDistance/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroLevenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences.

DefinitionMathematically, the Levenshtein distance between two strings a,b (of length |a| and |b| respectively) is given by lev_a,b(|a|,|b|) where ExampleThe Levenshtein distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is 3, since the following three edits change one into the other, and there is no way to do it with fewer than three edits: 1) kitten → sitten (substitution of “s” for “k”)2) sitten → sittin (substitution of “i” for “e”)3) sittin → sitting (insertion of “g” at the end) CodePython 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728#-*- coding: utf-8 -*-\"\"\"Levenshtein distance for measuring string differenceCreated on Apr. 6th, 2017@author: Stephen\"\"\"import numpy as npclass levenshtein_distance: def le_dis(self, input_x, input_y): xlen = len(input_x) + 1 ylen = len(input_y) + 1 dp = np.zeros(shape=(xlen, ylen), dtype=int) for i in range(0, xlen): dp[i][0] = i for j in range(0, ylen): dp[0][j] = j for i in range(1, xlen): for j in range(1, ylen): if input_x[i - 1] == input_y[j - 1]: dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] else: dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) return dp[xlen - 1][ylen - 1]if __name__ == '__main__': ld = levenshtein_distance() print(ld.le_dis('abcd', 'abd')) # print out 1 print(ld.le_dis('ace', 'abcd')) # print out 2 print(ld.le_dis('hello world', 'hey word')) # print out 4","categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Algorithm/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Levenshtein","slug":"Levenshtein","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Levenshtein/"},{"name":"Distance","slug":"Distance","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Distance/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Algorithm/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"What Is A Decision Tree ?

It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In this technique, the population or sample are split into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on most significant splitter differentiator in input variables. ExampleSay we have a sample of 30 students with three variables: Gender (Boy/Girl), Class(IX/X) and Height (5 to 6 ft). 15 out of these 30 play cricket in leisure time. Now, we want to create a model to predict who will play cricket during leisure period? In this problem, we need to segregate students who play cricket in their leisure time based on highly significant input variable among all three. This is where decision tree helps, it will segregate the students based on all values of three variables and identify the variable, which creates the best homogeneous sets of students (which are heterogeneous to each other). In the snapshot below, you can see that variable Gender is able to identify best homogeneous sets compared to the other two variables. As mentioned above, decision tree identifies the most significant variable and its value that gives best homogeneous sets of population. Now the question which arises is, how does it identify the variable and the split? To do this, decision tree uses various algorithms, which we will shall discuss in the following section. Types of Decision TreesTypes of decision tree are based on the type of target variable we have. It can be of two types: 1) Categorical Variable Decision Tree This type of Decision Tree which has categorical target variable then it called as categorical variable decision tree. E.g., in above scenario of student problem, where the target variable was “Student will play cricket or not” i.e. YES or NO. 2) Continuous Variable Decision Tree This type of Decision Tree has continuous target variable then it is called as Continuous Variable Decision Tree. ExampleLet’s say we have a problem to predict whether a customer will pay his renewal premium with an insurance company (yes/no). Here we know that income of a customer is a significant variable but insurance company does not have income details for all customers. Now, as we know this is an important variable, then we can build a decision tree to predict customer income based on occupation, age and various other variables. In this case, we are predicting values for continuous variable. Important TerminologyLet’s look at the basic terminology used with Decision trees: 1) Root Node It represents entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets. 2) Splitting It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes. 3) Decision Node When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called decision node. 4) Leaf/Terminal Node Nodes do not split is called Leaf or Terminal node. 5) PruningWhen we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. You can say opposite process of splitting. 6) Branch/Sub-Tree A sub section of entire tree is called branch or sub-tree. 7) Parent and Child Node A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called parent node of sub-nodes where as sub-nodes are the child of parent node. These above are the terms commonly used for decision trees. As we know that every algorithm has advantages and disadvantages, below are the important factors which one should know. Advantages1) Easy to Understand Decision tree output is very easy to understand even for people from non-analytical background. It does not require any statistical knowledge to read and interpret them. Its graphical representation is very intuitive and users can easily relate their hypothesis. 2) Useful in Data Exploration Decision tree is one of the fastest way to identify most significant variables and relation between two or more variables. With the help of decision trees, we can create new variables/features that has better power to predict target variable. For example, we are working on a problem where we have information available in hundreds of variables, there decision tree will help to identify most significant variable. 3) Less Data Cleaning Required It requires less data cleaning compared to some other modeling techniques. It is not influenced by outliers and missing values to a fair degree. 4) Data Type Is Not a Constraint It can handle both numerical and categorical variables. 5) Non Parametric Method Decision tree is considered to be a non-parametric method. This means that decision trees have no assumptions about the space distribution and the classifier structure. Disadvantages1) Over Fitting Over fitting is one of the most practical difficulty for decision tree models. This problem gets solved by setting constraints on model parameters and pruning (discussed in detailed below). 2) Not Fit for Continuous Variables While working with continuous numerical variables, decision tree looses information when it categorizes variables in different categories.","categories":[{"name":"Machine-Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Tree","slug":"Tree","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Tree/"},{"name":"Decision-Tree","slug":"Decision-Tree","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Decision-Tree/"}],"author":"Stephen
