Here are some common evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance of classification models. Confusion MatrixA confusion matrix (or, error matrix) is a visualization method for classifier algorithm results. More specifically, it is a table that breaks down the number of ground truth instances of a specific class against the number of predicted class instances. Accuracy: [(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)] Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances. It’s suitable for balanced datasets but can be misleading for imbalanced datasets. Higher accuracy values indicate a higher proportion of correct predictions. Precision: TP / (TP + FP) or predicted positives Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. Higher precision values indicate fewer false positive predictions. Precision is useful when the cost of false positives is high. Recall (Sensitivity)/TPR: TP / (TP + FN) or actual positives Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. It focuses on the ability of the model to capture positive instances. Higher recall values indicate fewer false negative predictions. Specificity/TNR : TN / (TN + FP) or actual negatives Specificity, also known as the true negative rate, is a metric used in binary classification tasks to evaluate the performance of a model in correctly identifying negative instances (actual negatives). Higher specificity values indicate fewer false positive predictions. False Positive Rate (FPR): FP / (FP + TN) or actual negatives Also known as the false alarm rate, it is a metric used in binary classification tasks to evaluate the performance of a model in correctly identifying negative instances. It is the complement of specificity. Lower FPR values indicate fewer false positive predictions. F1-score: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) The harmonic mean of precision and recall provides a balance between the two metrics. It’s useful when there’s an uneven class distribution.

This problem is known as overfitting. To avoid it, it is standard practice in supervised learning to set aside a portion of the data, called the test set (X_test, y_test), for evaluating the model’s performance. That is where K-Fold Cross-Validation comes in. It offers a sneak peek at how your model might fare in the real world. In this guide, we will unpack the basics of K-Fold Cross-Validation and compare it to simpler methods like the Train-Test Split. Cross Validation WorkflowK-Fold Cross-Validation is a robust technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. It helps ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data by using different portions of the dataset for training and testing in multiple iterations. Here is a flowchart of typical cross validation workflow in model training. The best parameters can be determined by grid search techniques. K-Fold Cross-Validation vs Train-Test SplitWhile K-Fold Cross-Validation partitions the dataset into multiple subsets to iteratively train and test the model, the Train-Test Split method divides the dataset into just two parts: one for training and the other for testing. The Train-Test Split method is simple and quick to implement, but the performance estimate can be highly dependent on the specific split, leading to high variance in the results. The images below illustrate the structural differences between these two methods. The first image shows the Train-Test Split method, where the dataset is divided into 80% training and 20% testing segments. The second image depicts a 5-Fold Cross-Validation, where the dataset is split into five parts, with each part serving as a test set in one of the five iterations, ensuring each segment is used for both training and testing. We can see that K-Fold Cross-Validation provides a more robust and reliable performance estimate because it reduces the impact of data variability. By using multiple training and testing cycles, it minimizes the risk of overfitting to a particular data split. This method also ensures that every data point is used for both training and validation, which results in a more comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance. What Does ‘K’ Represent in K-Fold Cross-Validation?In K-Fold Cross-Validation, K represents the number of groups into which the dataset is divided. This number determines how many rounds of testing the model undergoes, ensuring each segment is used as a testing set once. Here is a heuristic: K = 2 or 3: These choices can be beneficial when computational resources are limited or when a quicker evaluation is needed. They reduce the number of training cycles, thus saving time and computational power while still providing a reasonable estimate of model performance. K = 5 or 10: Choosing K = 5 or K = 10 are popular choices because they provide a good balance between computational efficiency and model performance estimation. K = 20: Using a larger value of K can provide a more detailed performance evaluation. However, it increases the computational burden and might result in higher variance if the subsets are too small. Implementing K-Fold Cross-Validation in PythonThe following example demonstrates how to estimate the accuracy of a linear kernel support vector machine on the iris dataset by splitting the data, fitting a model and computing the score 5 consecutive times (with different splits each time). 1234from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_scoreclf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=1, random_state=42)scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=5)scores array([0.96…, 1. , 0.96…, 0.96…, 1. ]) The mean score and the standard deviation are hence given by: 1print(\"%0.2f accuracy with a standard deviation of %0.2f\" % (scores.mean(), scores.std())) 0.98 accuracy with a standard deviation of 0.02 By default, the score computed at each CV (Cross Validation) iteration is the score method of the estimator. It is possible to change this by using the scoring parameter: 1234from sklearn import metricsscores = cross_val_score( clf, X, y, cv=5, scoring='f1_macro')scores array([0.96…, 1. …, 0.96…, 0.96…, 1. ]) When the cv argument is an integer, cross_val_score uses the KFold or StratifiedKFold strategies by default, the latter being used if the estimator derives from ClassifierMixin. It is also possible to use other cross validation strategies by passing a cross validation iterator instead, for instance: 1234from sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplitn_samples = X.shape[0]cv = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=5, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=cv) array([0.977…, 0.977…, 1. …, 0.955…, 1. ]) ConclusionThis guide has shown you how K-Fold Cross-Validation is a powerful tool for evaluating machine learning models. It’s better than the simple Train-Test Split because it tests the model on various parts of your data, helping you trust that it will work well on unseen data too.","categories":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Machine-Learning/"},{"name":"Cross Validation","slug":"Cross-Validation","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Cross-Validation/"},{"name":"Data Science","slug":"Data-Science","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Data-Science/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"The Stages of a Machine Learning Pipeline\n","slug":"The-stages-of-a-machine-learning-pipeline","date":"2024-02-06T14:00:31.000Z","updated":"2024-11-12T14:08:50.212Z","comments":true,"path":"2024/02/06/The-stages-of-a-machine-learning-pipeline/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2024/02/06/The-stages-of-a-machine-learning-pipeline/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroMachine learning technology is advancing at a rapid pace, but we can identify some broad steps involved in the process of building and deploying machine learning and deep learning models. A machine learning pipeline is a series of interconnected data processing and modeling steps designed to automate, standardize and streamline the process of building, training, evaluating and deploying machine learning models. Data CollectionIn this initial stage, new data is collected from various data sources, such as databases, APIs or files. This data ingestion often involves raw data which may require preprocessing to be useful. Data PreprocessingThis stage involves cleaning, transforming and preparing input data for modeling. Common preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Feature EngineeringFeature engineering is the process of creating new features or selecting relevant features from the data that can improve the model’s predictive power. This step often requires domain knowledge and creativity. Model SelectionIn this stage, you choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm(s) based on the problem type (e.g., classification, regression, clustering), data characteristics, and performance requirements. You may also consider hyperparameter tuning. Model TrainingThe selected model(s) are trained on the training dataset using the chosen algorithm(s). This involves learning the underlying patterns and relationships within the training data. Pre-trained models can also be used, rather than training a new model. Model EvaluationAfter training, the model’s performance is assessed using a separate testing dataset or through cross-validation. Common evaluation metrics depend on the specific problem but may include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error or others. Model DeploymentOnce a satisfactory model is developed and evaluated, it can be deployed to a production environment where it can make predictions on new, unseen data. Deployment may involve creating APIs and integrating with other systems. Monitoring and MaintenanceAfter deployment, it’s important to continuously monitor the model’s performance and retrain it as needed to adapt to changing data patterns. This step ensures that the model remains accurate and reliable in a real-world setting. ConclusionMachine learning lifecycles can vary in complexity and may involve additional steps depending on the use case, such as hyperparameter optimization, cross-validation, and feature selection. The goal of a machine learning pipeline is to automate and standardize these processes, making it easier to develop and maintain ML models for various applications.","categories":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Machine-Learning/"},{"name":"Data Science","slug":"Data-Science","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Data-Science/"},{"name":"Pipeline","slug":"Pipeline","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Pipeline/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"Data Collection and File Handling in Python","slug":"Data-Collection-and-File-Handling-in-Python","date":"2023-12-21T17:19:38.000Z","updated":"2024-11-12T03:54:12.958Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/12/21/Data-Collection-and-File-Handling-in-Python/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2023/12/21/Data-Collection-and-File-Handling-in-Python/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroGathering data is a critical first step in any data science project.

In a Tree, a single element can have multiple ‘next’ elements, allowing the data structure to branch out in various directions. The data structure is called a “tree” because it looks like a tree, only upside down. The Tree data structure can be useful in many cases: Hierarchical Data: File systems, organizational models, etc. Databases: Used for quick data retrieval. Routing Tables: Used for routing data in network algorithms. Sorting/Searching: Used for sorting data and searching for data. Priority Queues: Priority queue data structures are commonly implemented using trees, such as binary heaps. Types of TreesTrees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to represent hierarchical relationships. Binary Trees: Each node has up to two children, the left child node and the right child node. This structure is the foundation for more complex tree types like Binay Search Trees and AVL Trees. Binary Search Trees (BSTs): A type of Binary Tree where for each node, the left child node has a lower value, and the right child node has a higher value. AVL Trees: A type of Binary Search Tree that self-balances so that for every node, the difference in height between the left and right subtrees is at most one. This balance is maintained through rotations when nodes are inserted or deleted. Binary TreesA Binary Tree is a type of tree data structure where each node can have a maximum of two child nodes, a left child node and a right child node. This restriction, that a node can have a maximum of two child nodes, gives us many benefits: Algorithms like traversing, searching, insertion and deletion become easier to understand, to implement, and run faster. Keeping data sorted in a Binary Search Tree (BST) makes searching very efficient. Balancing trees is easier to do with a limited number of child nodes, using an AVL Binary Tree for example. Binary Trees can be represented as arrays, making the tree more memory efficient. Types of Binary TreesThere are different variants, or types, of Binary Trees worth discussing to get a better understanding of how Binary Trees can be structured. Below are short explanations of different types of Binary Tree structures. A balanced Binary Tree has at most 1 in difference between its left and right subtree heights, for each node in the tree. A complete Binary Tree has all levels full of nodes, except the last level, which is can also be full, or filled from left to right. The properties of a complete Binary Tree means it is also balanced. A full Binary Tree is a kind of tree where each node has either 0 or 2 child nodes. A perfect Binary Tree has all leaf nodes on the same level, which means that all levels are full of nodes, and all internal nodes have two child nodes.The properties of a perfect Binary Tree means it is also full, balanced, and complete. Implementation of Binary TreesTo avoid the cost of all the shifts in memory that we get from using Arrays, it is useful to implement Binary Trees with pointers from one element to the next, just like Binary Trees are implemented before this point, especially when the Binary Tree is modified often. But in case we read from the Binary Tree a lot more than we modify it, an Array implementation of a Binary Tree can make sense as it needs less memory, it can be easier to implement, and it can be faster for certain operations due to cache locality. Consider this Binary Tree: This Binary Tree can be stored in an Array starting with the root node R on index 0. The rest of the tree can be built by taking a node stored on index i, and storing its left child node on index 2⋅i + 1, and its right child node on index 2⋅i + 2. Below is an Array implementation of the Binary Tree. By comparing how these traversals are done in an array implementation to how the pointer implementation was traversed, you can see that the pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals works in the same recursive way. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526binary_tree_array = ['R', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'G']def left_child_index(index): return 2 * index + 1def right_child_index(index): return 2 * index + 2def pre_order(index): if index &gt;= len(binary_tree_array) or binary_tree_array[index] is None: return [] return [binary_tree_array[index]] + pre_order(left_child_index(index)) + pre_order(right_child_index(index))def in_order(index): if index &gt;= len(binary_tree_array) or binary_tree_array[index] is None: return [] return in_order(left_child_index(index)) + [binary_tree_array[index]] + in_order(right_child_index(index))def post_order(index): if index &gt;= len(binary_tree_array) or binary_tree_array[index] is None: return [] return post_order(left_child_index(index)) + post_order(right_child_index(index)) + [binary_tree_array[index]]print(\"Pre-order Traversal:\", pre_order(0))print(\"In-order Traversal:\", in_order(0))print(\"Post-order Traversal:\", post_order(0))","categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Algorithm/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Python/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Algorithm/"},{"name":"Binary Trees","slug":"Binary-Trees","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Binary-Trees/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"Building A Hash Set in Python","slug":"Building-A-Hash-Set-in-Python","date":"2022-11-20T16:37:02.000Z","updated":"2024-04-27T18:33:56.726Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/20/Building-A-Hash-Set-in-Python/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2022/11/20/Building-A-Hash-Set-in-Python/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroA Hash Set is a form of Hash Table data structure that usually holds a large number of elements. Using a Hash Set we can search, add, and remove elements really fast. Hash Sets are used for lookup, to check if an element is part of a set. A Hash Set stores unique elements in buckets according to the element’s hash code. Hash code: A number generated from an element’s unique value (key), to determine what bucket that Hash Set element belongs to. Unique elements: A Hash Set cannot have more than one element with the same value. Bucket: A Hash Set consists of many such buckets, or containers, to store elements. If two elements have the same hash code, they belong to the same bucket. Direct Access in Hash SetsSearching for Peter in the Hash Set above, means that the hash code 2 is generated (512 % 10), and that directs us right to the bucket Peter is in. If that is the only name in that bucket, we will find Peter right away. In cases like this we say that the Hash Set has constant time O(1) for searching, adding, and removing elements, which is really fast. But, if we search for Jens, we need to search through the other names in that bucket before we find Jens. In a worst case scenario, all names end up in the same bucket, and the name we are searching for is the last one. In such a worst case scenario the Hash Set has time complexity O(n), which is the same time complexity as arrays and linked lists. To keep Hash Sets fast, it is therefore important to have a hash function that will distribute the elements evenly between the buckets, and to have around as many buckets as Hash Set elements. Having a lot more buckets than Hash Set elements is a waste of memory, and having a lot less buckets than Hash Set elements is a waste of time. Hash Set ImplementationHash Sets in Python are typically done by using Python’s own set data type, but to get a better understanding of how Hash Sets work we will not use that here. To implement a Hash Set in Python we create a class SimpleHashSet. Inside the SimpleHashSet class we have a method __init__ to initialize the Hash Set, a method hash_function for the hash function, and methods for the basic Hash Set operations: add, contains, and remove. We also create a method print_set to better see how the Hash Set looks like. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354class SimpleHashSet: def __init__(self, size=100): self.size = size self.buckets = [[] for _ in range(size)] # A list of buckets, each is a list (to handle collisions) def hash_function(self, value): # Simple hash function: sum of character codes modulo the number of buckets return sum(ord(char) for char in value) % self.size def add(self, value): # Add a value if it's not already present index = self.hash_function(value) bucket = self.buckets[index] if value not in bucket: bucket.append(value) def contains(self, value): # Check if a value exists in the set index = self.hash_function(value) bucket = self.buckets[index] return value in bucket def remove(self, value): # Remove a value index = self.hash_function(value) bucket = self.buckets[index] if value in bucket: bucket.remove(value) def print_set(self): # Print all elements in the hash set print(\"Hash Set Contents:\") for index, bucket in enumerate(self.buckets): print(f\"Bucket &#123;index&#125;: &#123;bucket&#125;\")# Creating the Hash Set from the simulationhash_set = SimpleHashSet(size=10)hash_set.add(\"Charlotte\")hash_set.add(\"Thomas\")hash_set.add(\"Jens\")hash_set.add(\"Peter\")hash_set.add(\"Lisa\")hash_set.add(\"Adele\")hash_set.add(\"Michaela\")hash_set.add(\"Bob\")hash_set.print_set()print(\"\\n'Peter' is in the set:\",hash_set.contains('Peter'))print(\"Removing 'Peter'\")hash_set.remove('Peter')print(\"'Peter' is in the set:\",hash_set.contains('Peter'))print(\"'Adele' has hash code:\",hash_set.hash_function('Adele'))","categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Algorithm/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Python/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Algorithm/"},{"name":"Hash Set","slug":"Hash-Set","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Hash-Set/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"Building A Hash Table from Scratch in Python","slug":"Building-A-Hash-Table-from-Scratch-in-Python","date":"2022-09-13T03:07:23.000Z","updated":"2024-04-27T18:34:00.693Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/09/12/Building-A-Hash-Table-from-Scratch-in-Python/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2022/09/12/Building-A-Hash-Table-from-Scratch-in-Python/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroA Hash Table is a data structure designed to be fast to work with. The reason Hash Tables are sometimes preferred instead of arrays or linked lists is because searching for, adding, and deleting data can be done really quickly, even for large amounts of data. For example, with a Hash Table, finding “Bob” inside is done really fast because there is a way to go directly to where “Bob” is stored, using something called a hash function. Building A Hash Table from ScratchTo get the idea of what a Hash Table is, let’s try to build one from scratch, to store unique first names inside it. We will build the Hash Set in 5 steps: Starting with an array. Storing names using a hash function. Looking up an element using a hash function. Handling collisions. The basic Hash Set code example and simulation. Step 1: Starting with an arrayTo make interacting with the list of names really fast, let’s use a Hash Table, or a Hash Set, which is a simplified version of a Hash Table. To keep it simple, let’s assume there is at most 10 names in the list, so the array must be a fixed size of 10 elements. When talking about Hash Tables, each of these elements is called a bucket. 1my_hash_set = [None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None] Step 2: Storing names using a hash functionWe want to store a name directly into its right place in the array, and this is where the hash function comes in. A hash function can be made in many ways, it is up to the creator of the Hash Table. A common way is to find a way to convert the value into a number that equals one of the Hash Set’s index numbers, in this case a number from 0 to 9. In our example we will use the Unicode number of each character, summarize them and do a modulo 10 operation to get index numbers 0-9. The character “B” has Unicode code point 66, “o” has 111, and “b” has 98. Adding those together we get 275. Modulo 10 of 275 is 5, so “Bob” should be stored as an array element at index 5. The number returned by the hash function is called the hash code. 12345678def hash_function(value): sum_of_chars = 0 for char in value: sum_of_chars += ord(char) return sum_of_chars % 10print(\"'Bob' has hash code:\",hash_function('Bob')) After storing “Bob” where the hash code tells us (index 5), our array now looks like this: 1my_hash_set = [None,None,None,None,None,'Bob',None,None,None,None] Step 3: Looking up a name using a hash functionWe have now established a super basic Hash Set. To find out if “Pete” is stored in the array, we give the name “Pete” to our hash function, we get back hash code 9, we go directly to the element at index 9, and there he is. We found “Pete” without checking any other elements. When deleting a name from our Hash Set, we can also use the hash function to go straight to where the name is, and set that element value to None. 1234567891011121314my_hash_set = [None,'Jones',None,'Lisa',None,'Bob',None,'Siri','Pete',None]def hash_function(value): sum_of_chars = 0 for char in value: sum_of_chars += ord(char) return sum_of_chars % 10 def contains(name): index = hash_function(name) return my_hash_set[index] == nameprint(\"'Pete' is in the Hash Set:\",contains('Pete')) Step 4: Handling collisionsLet’s also add “Stuart” to our Hash Set. We give “Stuart” to our hash function, and we get the hash code 3, meaning “Stuart” should be stored at index 3. Trying to store “Stuart” creates what is called a collision, because “Lisa” is already stored at index 3. To fix the collision, we can make room for more elements in the same bucket, and solving the collision problem in this way is called chaining. We can give room for more elements in the same bucket by implementing each bucket as a linked list, or as an array. After implementing each bucket as an array, to give room for potentially more than one name in each bucket, “Stuart” can also be stored at index 3, and our Hash Set now looks like this: 123456789101112my_hash_set = [ [None], ['Jones'], [None], ['Lisa', 'Stuart'], [None], ['Bob'], [None], ['Siri'], ['Pete'], [None]] Step 5: Hash Set code exampleTo complete our very basic Hash Set code, let’s have functions for adding and searching for names in the Hash Set, which is now a two dimensional array. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031my_hash_set = [ [None], ['Jones'], [None], ['Lisa'], [None], ['Bob'], [None], ['Siri'], ['Pete'], [None]]def hash_function(value): return sum(ord(char) for char in value) % 10 def add(value): index = hash_function(value) bucket = my_hash_set[index] if value not in bucket: bucket.append(value) def contains(value): index = hash_function(value) bucket = my_hash_set[index] return value in bucketadd('Stuart')print(my_hash_set)print('Contains Stuart:',contains('Stuart')) Uses of Hash TablesHash Tables are great for: Checking if something is in a collection (like finding a book in a library). Storing unique items and quickly finding them (like storing phone numbers). Connecting values to keys (like linking names to phone numbers). The most important reason why Hash Tables are great for these things is that Hash Tables are very fast compared Arrays and Linked Lists, especially for large sets. Arrays and Linked Lists have time complexity O(n) for search and delete, while Hash Tables have just O(1) on average! SummarizedA Hash Table can be a Hash Set or a Hash Map. Hash Table elements are stored in storage containers called buckets. Every Hash Table element has a part that is unique that is called the key. A hash function takes the key of an element to generate a hash code.","categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Algorithm/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Python/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Algorithm/"},{"name":"Hash Table","slug":"Hash-Table","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Hash-Table/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"Delete and Insert a Node in a Linked List in Python","slug":"Delete-and-Insert-a-Node-in-a-Linked-List","date":"2022-07-22T18:03:20.000Z","updated":"2024-04-27T18:33:26.400Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/07/22/Delete-and-Insert-a-Node-in-a-Linked-List/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2022/07/22/Delete-and-Insert-a-Node-in-a-Linked-List/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroBasic things we can do with linked lists are: Traversal Remove a node Insert a node Sort For simplicity, singly linked lists will be used to explain these operations below. Delete a Node in a Linked ListIn this case we have the link (or pointer or address) to a node that we want to delete. It is important to connect the nodes on each side of the node before deleting it, so that the linked list is not broken. So before deleting the node, we need to get the next pointer from the previous node, and connect the previous node to the new next node before deleting the node in between. In a singly linked list, like we have here, to get the next pointer from the previous node we actually need traverse the list from the start, because there is no way to go backwards from the node we want to delete. In the code below, the algorithm to delete a node is moved into a function called deleteSpecificNode, the return value is the new head of the linked list. So for example, if the node to be deleted is the first node, the new head returned will be the next node. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647class Node: def __init__(self, data): self.data = data self.next = Nonedef traverseAndPrint(head): currentNode = head while currentNode: print(currentNode.data, end=\" -&gt; \") currentNode = currentNode.next print(\"null\")def deleteSpecificNode(head, nodeToDelete): if head == nodeToDelete: return head.next currentNode = head while currentNode.next and currentNode.next != nodeToDelete: currentNode = currentNode.next if currentNode.next is None: return head currentNode.next = currentNode.next.next return headnode1 = Node(7)node2 = Node(11)node3 = Node(3)node4 = Node(2)node5 = Node(9)node1.next = node2node2.next = node3node3.next = node4node4.next = node5print(\"Before deletion:\")traverseAndPrint(node1)# Delete node4node1 = deleteSpecificNode(node1, node4)print(\"\\nAfter deletion:\")traverseAndPrint(node1) Insert a Node in a Linked ListInserting a node into a linked list is very similar to deleting a node, because in both cases we need to take care of the next pointers to make sure we do not break the linked list. To insert a node in a linked list we first need to create the node, and then at the position where we insert it, we need to adjust the pointers so that the previous node points to the new node, and the new node points to the correct next node. In the insertNodeAtPosition function below, the return value is the new head of the linked list.

It takes an array of values, chooses one of the values as the ‘pivot’ element, and moves the other values so that lower values are on the left of the pivot element, and higher values are on the right of it. In this tutorial the last element of the array is chosen to be the pivot element, but we could also have chosen the first element of the array, or any element in the array really. Then, the Quicksort algorithm does the same operation recursively on the sub-arrays to the left and right side of the pivot element. This continues until the array is sorted. How it works? Choose a value in the array to be the pivot element. Order the rest of the array so that lower values than the pivot element are on the left, and higher values are on the right. Swap the pivot element with the first element of the higher values so that the pivot element lands in between the lower and higher values. Do the same operations (recursively) for the sub-arrays on the left and right side of the pivot element. Manual Run ThroughStep 1: We start with an unsorted array. 1[ 11, 9, 12, 7, 3] Step 2: We choose the last value 3 as the pivot element. 1[ 11, 9, 12, 7, 3] Step 3: The rest of the values in the array are all lower than 3, an must be on the right side of 3. Swap 3 with 11. 1[ 3, 9, 12, 7, 11] Step 4: Value 3 is now in the correct position. We need to sort the values to the right of 3. We choose the last value 11 as the new pivot element. 1[ 3, 9, 12, 7, 11] Step 5: The value 7 must be to the left of pivot value 11, and 12 must be to the right of it. Move 7 and 12. 1[ 3, 9, 7, 12, 11] Step 6: Swap 11 with 12 so that lower values 9 anf 7 are on the left side of 11, and 12 is on the right side. 1[ 3, 9, 7, 11, 12] Step 7: 11 and 12 are in the correct positions. We choose 7 as the pivot element in sub-array [ 9, 7], to the left of 11. 1[ 3, 9, 7, 11, 12] Step 8: We must swap 9 with 7. 1[ 3, 7, 9, 11, 12] Finally, the array is sorted. ImplementationTo implement the Quicksort algorithm in a programming language, we need: An array with values to sort. A quickSort method that calls itself (recursion) if the sub-array has a size larger than 1. A partition method that receives a sub-array, moves values around, swaps the pivot element into the sub-array and returns the index where the next split in sub-arrays happens. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425def partition(array, low, high): pivot = array[high] i = low - 1 for j in range(low, high): if array[j] &lt;= pivot: i += 1 array[i], array[j] = array[j], array[i] array[i+1], array[high] = array[high], array[i+1] return i+1def quicksort(array, low=0, high=None): step = 0 if high is None: high = len(array) - 1 if low &lt; high: pivot_index = partition(array, low, high) print(\"The sorted array after &#123;0&#125; step: \".format(low+1), array) quicksort(array, low, pivot_index-1) quicksort(array, pivot_index+1, high)my_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90, 5]quicksort(my_array)print(\"Sorted array:\", my_array) Time ComplexityThe worst case scenario for Quicksort is O(nn). This is when the pivot element is either the highest or lowest value in every sub-array, which leads to a lot of recursive calls. With our implementation above, this happens when the array is already sorted But on average, the time complexity for Quicksort is actually just O(nlogn). The recursion part of the Quicksort algorithm is actually a reason why the average sorting scenario is so fast, because for good picks of the pivot element, the array will be split in half somewhat evenly each time the algorithm calls itself. So the number of recursive calls do not double, even if the number of values n double.","categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Algorithm/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Algorithm/"},{"name":"Sort","slug":"Sort","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Sort/"},{"name":"Quicksort","slug":"Quicksort","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Quicksort/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"How to Choose the Right Machine Learning Model for Different Data and Different Problems","slug":"How-to-Choose-the-Right-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Different-Data-and-Different-Problems","date":"2021-11-22T18:37:44.000Z","updated":"2024-04-27T18:22:23.469Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/11/22/How-to-Choose-the-Right-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Different-Data-and-Different-Problems/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2021/11/22/How-to-Choose-the-Right-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Different-Data-and-Different-Problems/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroDiscovering a ideal model, an estimator or a classifier for a machine learning task can often pose the greatest challenge.

Hyperparameter tuning can lead to much better performance on test sets. However, optimizing parameters to the test set can lead information leakage causing the model to preform worse on unseen data. To correct for this we can perform cross validation. To better understand CV, we will be performing different methods on the iris dataset. K-FoldThe training data used in the model is split, into k number of smaller sets, to be used to validate the model. The model is then trained on k-1 folds of training set. The remaining fold is then used as a validation set to evaluate the model. As we will be trying to classify different species of iris flowers we will need to import a classifier model, for this exercise we will be using a DecisionTreeClassifier. 123456789101112131415from sklearn import datasetsfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifierfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold, StratifiedKFoldfrom sklearn.model_selection import LeaveOneOut, LeavePOutfrom sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit, cross_val_scoreX, y = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)k_folds = KFold(n_splits = 5)scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv = k_folds)print(\"Cross Validation Scores: \", scores[:3])print(\"Average CV Score: \", scores.mean())print(\"Number of CV Scores used in Average: \", len(scores)) 123Cross Validation Scores: [1. 1. 0.83333333]Average CV Score: 0.9133333333333333Number of CV Scores used in Average: 5 Stratified K-FoldIn cases where classes are imbalanced we need a way to account for the imbalance in both the train and validation sets.

In this case there are 150 observations in the iris dataset. The average CV score is 94%.

Bootstrap Aggregation (bagging) is a ensembling method that attempts to resolve overfitting for classification or regression problems. Bagging aims to improve the accuracy and performance of machine learning algorithms. It does this by taking random subsets of an original dataset, with replacement, and fits either a classifier (for classification) or regressor (for regression) to each subset. The predictions for each subset are then aggregated through majority vote for classification or averaging for regression, increasing prediction accuracy. Evaluating the Base ClassifierTo see how bagging can improve model performance, we must start by evaluating how the base classifier performs on the dataset. We will be looking to identify different classes of wines found in Sklearn’s wine dataset. The parameter as_frame is set equal to True so we do not lose the feature names when loading the data. We can predict the class of wine the unseen test set and evaluate the model performance. 12345678910111213141516171819202122from sklearn import datasetsfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_splitfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_scorefrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifierfrom sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifierfrom sklearn.tree import plot_treeimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltdata = datasets.load_wine(as_frame = True)X = data.datay = data.targetX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 22)dtree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = 22)dtree.fit(X_train,y_train)y_pred = dtree.predict(X_test)print(\"Train data accuracy:\",accuracy_score(y_true = y_train, y_pred = dtree.predict(X_train)))print(\"Test data accuracy:\",accuracy_score(y_true = y_test, y_pred = y_pred)) 12Train data accuracy: 1.0Test data accuracy: 0.8222222222222222 The base classifier performs reasonably well on the dataset achieving 82% accuracy on the test dataset with the current parameters (Different results may occur if you do not have the random_state parameter set). Now that we have a baseline accuracy for the test dataset, we can see how the Bagging Classifier out performs a single Decision Tree Classifier. Creating a Bagging ClassifierFor bagging we need to set the parameter n_estimators, this is the number of base classifiers that our model is going to aggregate together. For this sample dataset the number of estimators is relatively low, it is often the case that much larger ranges are explored. Hyperparameter tuning is usually done with a grid search, but for now we will use a select set of values for the number of estimators. We start by importing the necessary model. To see how the Bagging Classifier performs with differing values of n_estimators we need a way to iterate over the range of values and store the results from each ensemble. The default parameter for the base classifier in BaggingClassifier is the DicisionTreeClassifier therefore we do not need to set it when instantiating the bagging model. With the models and scores stored, we can evaluate and visualize the BaggingClassifier performance. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728estimator_range = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16]models = []scores = []for n_estimators in estimator_range: # Create bagging classifier clf = BaggingClassifier(n_estimators = n_estimators, random_state = 22) # Fit the model clf.fit(X_train, y_train) # Append the model and score to their respective list models.append(clf) scores.append(accuracy_score(y_true = y_test, y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)))# Generate the plot of scores against number of estimatorsplt.figure(figsize=(9,6))plt.plot(estimator_range, scores)# Adjust labels and font (to make visable)plt.xlabel(\"n_estimators\", fontsize = 18)plt.ylabel(\"score\", fontsize = 18)plt.tick_params(labelsize = 16)# Visualize plotplt.show() By iterating through different values for the number of estimators we can see an increase in model performance from 82.2% to 95.5%. After 14 estimators the accuracy begins to drop, again if you set a different random_state the values you see will vary. That is why it is best practice to use cross validation to ensure stable results. In this case, we see a 13.3% increase in accuracy when it comes to identifying the type of the wine. Another Form of EvaluationAs bootstrapping chooses random subsets of observations to create classifiers, there are observations that are left out in the selection process. These “out-of-bag” observations can then be used to evaluate the model, similarly to that of a test set. Keep in mind, that out-of-bag estimation can overestimate error in binary classification problems and should only be used as a compliment to other metrics. We saw in the last example that 12 estimators yielded the highest accuracy, so we will use that to create our model. This time setting the parameter oob_score to true to evaluate the model with out-of-bag score. 12345678oob_model = BaggingClassifier(n_estimators = 12, oob_score = True,random_state = 22)oob_model.fit(X_train, y_train)y_pred2 = oob_model.predict(X_test)print(\"Out-of-bag test data accuracy:\",accuracy_score(y_true = y_test, y_pred = y_pred2))print(\"Out-of-bag score:\", oob_model.oob_score_) 12Out-of-bag test data accuracy: 0.9555555555555556Out-of-bag score: 0.9398496240601504 Since the samples used in OOB and the test set are different, and the dataset is relatively small, there is a difference in the accuracy score (93.98%). It is rare that they would be exactly the same, again OOB should be used quick means for estimating error, but is not the only evaluation metric. The bagging classifier performs pretty well on the dataset achieving 95.5% accuracy on the test dataset with 12 estimators. Generating Decision TreesIt is possible to see the individual decision trees that went into the aggregated classifier. This helps us to gain a more intuitive understanding on how the bagging model arrives at its predictions. However, this is only functional with smaller datasets, where the trees are relatively shallow and narrow making them easy to visualize. The different trees can be graphed by changing the estimator you wish to visualize. 123456789clf2 = BaggingClassifier(n_estimators = 12, oob_score = True,random_state = 22)clf2.fit(X_train, y_train)plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))plot_tree(clf2.estimators_[0], feature_names = X.columns)plt.show() Here we can see just the first decision tree that was used to vote on the final prediction. Again, by changing the index of the classifier you can see each of the trees that have been aggregated.","categories":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Machine-Learning/"},{"name":"Bagging Classifier","slug":"Bagging-Classifier","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Bagging-Classifier/"},{"name":"Bootstrap Aggregation","slug":"Bootstrap-Aggregation","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Bootstrap-Aggregation/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"Choosing the Best Value for K in K-means by Using the Elbow Method","slug":"choosing-the-best-value-for-K-in-K-means-byusing-the-elbow-method","date":"2021-03-11T02:24:38.000Z","updated":"2024-04-11T14:02:17.544Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/03/10/choosing-the-best-value-for-K-in-K-means-byusing-the-elbow-method/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2021/03/10/choosing-the-best-value-for-K-in-K-means-byusing-the-elbow-method/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroK-means is an unsupervised learning method for clustering data points. The algorithm iteratively divides data points into K clusters by minimizing the variance in each cluster. Here, we will show you how to estimate the best value for K using the elbow method, then use K-means clustering to group the data points into clusters. K-meansFirst, each data point is randomly assigned to one of the K clusters. Then, we compute the centroid (functionally the center) of each cluster, and reassign each data point to the cluster with the closest centroid. We repeat this process until the cluster assignments for each data point are no longer changing. K-means clustering requires us to select K, the number of clusters we want to group the data into. The elbow method lets us graph the inertia (a distance-based metric) and visualize the point at which it starts decreasing linearly. This point is referred to as the “eblow” and is a good estimate for the best value for K based on our data. ExampleIn order to find the best value for K, we need to run K-means across our data for a range of possible values. We only have 10 data points, so the maximum number of clusters is 10.

It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version, Detectron, and it originates from Mask R-CNN. Table detection is a crucial step in many document analysis applications as tables are used for presenting essential information to the reader in a structured manner. It is a hard problem due to varying layouts and encodings of the tables. Researchers have proposed numerous techniques for table detection based on layout analysis of documents. Most of these techniques fail to generalize because they rely on hand engineered features which are not robust to layout variations. In this post, we propose a detectron2 based method for table detection. Why use detectron2? It is powered by the PyTorch deep learning framework. It Include more features such as panoptic segmentation, Densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, PointRend, DeepLab, etc. It can be used as a library to support different projects on top of it.

The method uses ‘Soft-Masked BERT’ is general, and it may be employed in other language detection-correction problems not just focusing on CSC (Chinese Spelling error Correction) domain as it’s proposed in the original paper. The Architecture of Soft-Masked BERTSoft-Masked BERT is composed of a detection network based on Bi-GRU and a correction network based on BERT. The detection network predicts the probabilities of errors and the correction network predicts the probabilities of error corrections, while the former passes its prediction results to the latter using soft masking. The Model first creates an embedding for each character in the input sentence, referred to as input embedding. Next, it takes the sequence of embeddings as input and outputs the probabilities of errors for the sequence of characters (embeddings) using the detection network. After that it calculates the weighted sum of the input embeddings and [MASK] embeddings weighted by the error probabilities. The calculated embeddings mask the likely errors in the sequence in a soft way. Then it takes the sequence of soft-masked embeddings as input and outputs the probabilities of error corrections using the correction network, which is a BERT model whose final layer consists of a softmax function for all characters. There is also a residual connection between the input embeddings and the embeddings at the final layer.

It has caused a stir in the Machine Learning community by presenting state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of NLP tasks, including Question Answering, Natural Language Inference, and others. BERT’s key technical innovation is applying the bidirectional training of Transformer, a popular attention model, to language modelling. This is in contrast to previous efforts which looked at a text sequence either from left to right or combined left-to-right and right-to-left training. The results show that a language model which is bidirectionally trained can have a deeper sense of language context and flow than single-direction language models. BERT makes use of Transformer, an attention mechanism that learns contextual relations between words (or sub-words) in a text. Transformer includes two separate mechanisms — an encoder that reads the text input and a decoder that produces a prediction for the task. As opposed to directional models, which read the text input sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left), the Transformer encoder reads the entire sequence of words at once. Therefore it is considered bidirectional, though it would be more accurate to say that it’s non-directional. This characteristic allows the model to learn the context of a word based on all of its surroundings (left and right of the word).

It then compares all permutations (insertions, deletions, replacements, and transpositions) to known words in a word frequency list. Those words that are found more often in the frequency list are more likely the correct results. The correction(A) function tries to choose the most likely spelling correction for A. There is no way to know for sure (for example, should “lates” be corrected to “late” or “latest” or “lattes” or …?), which suggests we use probabilities. We are trying to find the correction B, out of all possible candidate corrections, that maximizes the probability that B is the intended correction, given the original word A.

Sometimes, when you find a fantastic GitHub repository which share a pre-trained model on a framework which you are not familiar with. For example, you are an expert PyTorch deep learning code developer, meanwhile you find a great code with its pre-trained model on MXNet; and you want to modify this model according to your needs. Thus, deep learning model conversion tools are extremely needed. As each framework has its own structure, converting a model between two different frameworks requires a great knowledge of both of them. However, There are many fantastic model conversion tools such as ONNX, MMdnn, and etc. for converting and visualizing deep models between a wide collection of frameworks. Model Convertors ONNX ONNX is an effort to unify converters for neural networks in order to bring some sanity to the NN world. Released by Facebook and Microsoft. MMdnn MMdnn (Model Management Deep Neural Network) is supported by Microsoft, By using MMdnn, one can convert each model from the origin framework to a standard Intermediate Representation (IR), and then convert the IR format to the target framework structure. It can convert models between CaffeEmit, CNTK, CoreML, Keras, MXNet, ONNX, PyTorch and TensorFlow. PyTorch convertor PyTorch convertor can convert models to PyTorch model. TensorFlow convertor TensorFlow convertor can convert models to TensorFlow model. Keras convertor Keras convertor can convert models to Keras model. MXNet convertor MXNet convertor can convert models to MXNet model. Caffe convertor Caffe convertor can convert models to Caffe model. Caffe2 convertor Caffe2 convertor can convert models to Caffe2 model. CNTK convertor CNTK convertor can convert models to CNTK model.

Torch convertor Torch convertor can convert models to Torch model. Neon convertor Neon convertor can convert models to Neon model. CoreML convertor CoreML convertor can convert models to coreML model. Paddle convertor Paddle convertor can convert models to Paddle model. Chainer convertor Chainer convertor can convert models to Chainer model. A Demo of Model Convertion from MXNet to PyTorch Here is an appropriate example to convert the Full ImageNet pre-trained model from MXNet to PyTorch via MMdnn convertor. ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images. Since 2010, the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) is a competition where research teams evaluate their algorithms on the given data set, and compete to achieve higher accuracy on several visual recognition tasks. A common reason to train a network on ImageNet data is to use it for transfer learning (including feature extraction or fine-tuning other models). Having a pre-trained model which is trained on such a huge training data set (i.e., full ImageNet), would be a really valuable network. It can speed up the convergence early in the training phase, and also improves the target task accuracy in some scenarios.

The silhouette ranges from −1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters. Thus silhouette analysis can be used to choose an optimal number for clusters automatically. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Hierarchical clustering algorithms fall into 2 branches: top-down or bottom-up. Bottom-up algorithms treat each data point as a single cluster at the outset and then successively merge (or agglomerate) pairs of clusters until all clusters have been merged into a single cluster that contains all data points. Bottom-up hierarchical clustering is therefore called hierarchical agglomerative clustering or HAC. This hierarchy of clusters is represented as a tree (or dendrogram). The root of the tree is the unique cluster that gathers all the samples, the leaves being the clusters with only one sample. The Steps of Hierarchical clustering: We start by treating each data point as a single cluster i.e. if there are N data points in our dataset then we have N clusters. We then select a distance metric that measures the distance between two clusters. As an example, we will use average linkage which defines the distance between two clusters to be the average distance between data points in the first cluster and data points in the second cluster. On each iteration, two clusters are combined into one. The two clusters to be combined are selected as those with the smallest average linkage. I.e. according to our selected distance metric, these two clusters have the smallest distance between each other and therefore are the most similar and should be combined. Step 2 is repeated until we reach the root of the tree that one cluster contains all data points. In this way we can select how many clusters we want in the end simply by choosing when to stop combining the clusters i.e. when we stop building the tree! Automatic ClusteringSince hierarchical clustering does not require us to specify the number of clusters and we can even select which number of clusters looks best since we are building a tree. Here we use the silhouette score to help us determine choosing the optimal number of clusters for clustering task automatically. An example of auto-clustering with silhouette analysis on agglomerative hierarchical clustering is shown as follows. 12345678import pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCAfrom sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClusteringfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, normalizefrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_scoreimport scipy.cluster.hierarchy as shc Load and clean the data: 1234567X = pd.read_csv('customer_info.csv')# Dropping the CUST_ID column from the dataX = X.drop('CUST_ID', axis = 1)# Handling the missing valuesX.fillna(method ='ffill', inplace = True) Preprocess the data: 12345678910# Scaling the data so that all the features become comparablescaler = StandardScaler()X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)# Normalizing the data so that the data approximately # follows a Gaussian distributionX_normalized = normalize(X_scaled)# Converting the numpy array into a pandas DataFrameX_normalized = pd.DataFrame(X_normalized) Reduce the dimensionality: 1234pca = PCA(n_components = 2)X_new = pca.fit_transform(X_normalized)df_new = pd.DataFrame(X_new)df_new.columns = ['P1', 'P2'] Visualize the dendograms: 123plt.figure(figsize =(8, 8))plt.title('Visualising Clustering')Dendrogram = shc.dendrogram((shc.linkage(df_new, method ='ward'))) Evaluate the clustering models: 123456789101112131415161718k = range(2,10)ac_list = [AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters = i) for i in k]# Appending the silhouette scoressilhouette_scores = &#123;&#125;silhouette_scores.fromkeys(k)for i,j in enumerate(k): silhouette_scores[j] = silhouette_score(df_new, ac_list[i].fit_predict(df_new))# Plottingy = list(silhouette_scores.values())plt.bar(k, y)plt.xlabel('Number of clusters', fontsize = 20)plt.ylabel('S(i)', fontsize = 20)plt.show() From the result above, we can conclude that 3 clusters obtain the highest silhouette score so the optimal number of clusters is 3 in this case.

It supports object detection and it’s built in Python, using TensorFlow. The code is open source and available on GitHub. Detecting Objects with a Pre-trained ModelThe first thing is being familiarized with the Luminoth CLI tool, that is, the tool that you interact with using the lumi command. This is the main gate to Luminoth, allowing you to train new models, evaluate them, use them for predictions, manage the checkpoints and more. If we want Luminoth to predict the objects present in one of pictures (image.jpg). The way to do that is by running the following command: 1lumi predict image.jpg The result will be like this: 123Found 1 files to predict.Neither checkpoint not config specified, assuming `accurate`.Checkpoint not found. Check remote repository? [y/N]: Since you didn’t tell Luminoth what an “object” is for you, nor have taught it how to recognize said objects. So one way to do this is to use a pre-trained model that has been trained to detect popular types of objects. E.g., it can be a model trained with COCO dataset or Pascal VOC. What’s more, each pre-trained model might be associated with a different algorithm. The checkpoints correspond to the weights of a particular model (Faster R-CNN or SSD), trained with a particular dataset. The case of “accurate” is just a label for a particular Deep Learning model underneath, here, Faster R-CNN, trained with images from the COCO dataset. After the checkpoint download, with these commands we can output everything (a resulting image and a json file) to a preds directory: 12mkdir predslumi predict image.jpg -f preds/objects.json -d preds/ Exploring the Pre-trained CheckpointsFirst, run the lumi checkpoint refresh command, so Luminoth knows about the checkpoints that it has available for download. After refreshing the local index, you can list the available checkpoints running lumi checkpoint list: 123456================================================================================| id | name | alias | source | status |================================================================================| e1c2565b51e9 | Faster R-CNN w/COCO | accurate | remote | DOWNLOADED || aad6912e94d9 | SSD w/Pascal VOC | fast | remote | NOT_DOWNLOADED |================================================================================ Here, you can see the “accurate” checkpoint and another “fast” checkpoint that is the SSD model trained with Pascal VOC dataset. Let’s get some information about the “accurate” checkpoint by the following command: 1lumi checkpoint info e1c2565b51e9 or 1lumi checkpoint info accurate If getting predictions for an image or video using a specific checkpoint (e.g., fast) you can do so by using the –checkpoint parameter: 1lumi predict img.jpg --checkpoint fast -f preds/objects.json -d preds/ Playing Around with the Built-in InterfaceLuminoth includes a simple web frontend so you can play around with detected objects in images using different thresholds. To launch this, simply type lumi server web and then open your browser at http://localhost:5000. If you are running on an external VM, you can do lumi server web –host 0.0.0.0 –port to open in a custom port. Building Custom datasetIn order to use a custom dataset, we must first transform whatever format your data is in, to TFRecords files (one for each split — train, val, test). Luminoth reads datasets natively only in TensorFlow’s TFRecords format. This is a binary format that will let Luminoth consume the data very efficiently. Fortunately, Luminoth provides several CLI tools for transforming popular dataset format (such as Pascal VOC, ImageNet, COCO, CSV, etc.) into TFRecords. We should start by downloading the annotation files (this and this, for train) and the class description file. After we get the class-descriptions-boxable.csv file, we can go over all the classes available in the OpenImages dataset and see which ones are related to traffic dataset. The following were hand-picked after examining the full file: 12345678/m/015qff,Traffic light/m/0199g,Bicycle/m/01bjv,Bus/m/01g317,Person/m/04_sv,Motorcycle/m/07r04,Truck/m/0h2r6,Van/m/0k4j,Car Luminoth includes a dataset reader that can take OpenImages format, the dataset reader expects a particular directory layout so it knows where the files are located. In this case, files corresponding to the examples must be in a folder named like their split (train, test, …). So, you should have the following: 12345.├── class-descriptions-boxable.csv└── train ├── train-annotations-bbox.csv └── train-annotations-human-imagelabels-boxable.csv Then run the following command: 1234567lumi dataset transform \\ --type openimages \\ --data-dir . \\ --output-dir ./out \\ --split train \\ --class-examples 100 \\ --only-classes=/m/015qff,/m/0199g,/m/01bjv,/m/01g317,/m/04_sv,/m/07r04,/m/0h2r6,/m/0k4j This will generate TFRecord file for the train split: 12345678910INFO:tensorflow:Saved 360 records to \"./out/train.tfrecords\"INFO:tensorflow:Composition per class (train):INFO:tensorflow: Person (/m/01g317): 380INFO:tensorflow: Car (/m/0k4j): 255INFO:tensorflow: Bicycle (/m/0199g): 126INFO:tensorflow: Bus (/m/01bjv): 106INFO:tensorflow: Traffic light (/m/015qff): 105INFO:tensorflow: Truck (/m/07r04): 101INFO:tensorflow: Van (/m/0h2r6): 100INFO:tensorflow: Motorcycle (/m/04_sv): 100 Training the ModelTraining orchestration, including the model to be used, the dataset location and training schedule, is specified in a YAML config file. This file will be consumed by Luminoth and merged to the default configuration, to start the training session. You can see a minimal config file example in sample_config.yml. This file illustrates the entries you’ll most probably need to modify, which are: 1) train.run_name: the run name for the training session, used to identify it.2) train.job_dir: directory in which both model checkpoints and summaries (for TensorBoard consumption) will be saved. The actual files will be stored under /.3) dataset.dir: directory from which to read the TFRecord files.4) model.type: model to use for object detection (fasterrcnn, or ssd).5) network.num_classes: number of classes to predict (depends on your dataset). For looking at all the possible configuration options, mostly related to the model itself, you can check the base_config.yml file. Building the config file for the datasetProbably the most important setting for training is the learning rate. You will most likely want to tune this depending on your dataset, and you can do it via the train.learning_rate setting in the configuration. For example, this would be a good setting for training on the full COCO dataset: 1234learning_rate: decay_method: piecewise_constant boundaries: [250000, 450000, 600000] values: [0.0003, 0.0001, 0.00003, 0.00001] To get to this, you will need to run some experiments and see what works best. 12345678910111213141516171819train: # Run name for the training session. run_name: traffic job_dir: &lt;change this directory&gt; learning_rate: decay_method: piecewise_constant # Custom dataset for Luminoth Tutorial boundaries: [90000, 160000, 250000] values: [0.0003, 0.0001, 0.00003, 0.00001]dataset: type: object_detection dir: &lt;directory with your dataset&gt;model: type: fasterrcnn network: num_classes: 8 anchors: # Add one more scale to be better at detecting small objects scales: [0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2] Running the trainingAssuming you already have both your dataset (TFRecords) and the config file ready, you can start your training session by running the command as follows: 1lumi train -c config.yml You can use the -o option to override any configuration option using dot notation (e.g. -o model.rpn.proposals.nms_threshold=0.8). If you are using a CUDA-based GPU, you can select the GPU to use by setting the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable. Storing checkpoints (partial weights)As the training progresses, Luminoth will periodically save a checkpoint with the current weights of the model. The files will be output in your / folder. By default, they will be saved every 600 seconds of training, but you can configure this with the train.save_checkpoint_secs setting in your config file. The default is to only store the latest checkpoint (that is, when a checkpoint is generated, the previous checkpoint gets deleted) in order to conserve storage. Evaluating ModelsGenerally, datasets (like OpenImages, which we just used) provide “splits”. The “train” split is the largest, and the one from which the model actually does the learning. Then, you have the “validation” (or “val”) split, which consists of different images, in which you can draw metrics of your model’s performance, in order to better tune your hyperparameters. Finally, a “test” split is provided in order to conduct the final evaluation of how your model would perform in the real world once it is trained. Building a validation datasetLet’s start by building TFRecords from the validation split of OpenImages. For this, we can download the files with the annotations and use the same lumi dataset transform that we used to build our training data. In your dataset folder (where the class-descriptions-boxable.csv is located), run the following commands: 123mkdir validationwget -P validation https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/2018_04/validation/validation-annotations-bbox.csvwget -P validation https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/2018_04/validation/validation-annotations-human-imagelabels-boxable.csv After the downloads finish, we can build the TFRecords with the following: 1234567lumi dataset transform \\ --type openimages \\ --data-dir . \\ --output-dir ./out \\ --split validation \\ --class-examples 100 \\ --only-classes=/m/015qff,/m/0199g,/m/01bjv,/m/01g317,/m/04_sv,/m/07r04,/m/0h2r6,/m/0k4j The lumi eval commandIn Luminoth, lumi eval will make a run through your chosen dataset split (ie. validation or test), and run the model through every image, and then compute metrics like loss and mAP. If you are lucky and happen to have more than one GPU in your machine, it is advisable to run both train and eval at the same time. Start by running the evaluation: 1lumi eval --split validation -c custom.yml The mAP metricsMean Average Precision (mAP) is the metric commonly used to evaluate object detection task. It computes how well your classifier works across all classes, mAP will be a number between 0 and 1, and the higher the better. Moreover, it can be calculated across different IoU (Intersection over Union) thresholds. For example, Pascal VOC challenge metric uses 0.5 as threshold (notation mAP@0.5), and COCO dataset uses mAP at different thresholds and averages them all out (notation mAP@[0.5:0.95]). Luminoth will print out several of these metrics, specifying the thresholds that were used under this notation. Using TensorBoard for VisualizingTensorBoard is a very good tool for this, allowing you to see plenty of plots with the training related metrics. By default, Luminoth writes TensorBoard summaries during training, so you can leverage this tool without any effort: 1tensorboard --logdir &lt;job_dir&gt;/&lt;run_name&gt; If you are running from an external VM, make sure to use --host 0.0.0.0 and --port if you need other one than the default 6006. What to look forFirst, go to the “Scalars” tab. You are going to see several tags. validation_lossesHere, you will get the same loss values that Luminoth computes for the train, but for the chosen dataset split (validation, in this case). As in the case of train, you should mostly look at validation_losses/no_reg_loss. These will be the mAP metrics that will help you judge how well your model perform: The mAP values refer to the entire dataset split, so it will not jump around as much as other metrics. Manually inspecting with lumi server webYou can also use lumi server web command that we have seen before and try your partially trained model in a bunch of novel images. For this, you can launch it with a config file like: 1lumi server web -c config.yml Here you can also use –host and –port options. Creating and Sharing Your Own CheckpointsCreating a checkpointWe can create checkpoints and set some metadata like name, alias, etc. This time, we are going to create the checkpoint for our traffic model: 1234lumi checkpoint create \\ config.yml \\ -e name=\"OpenImages Traffic\" \\ -e alias=traffic You can verify that you do indeed have the checkpoint when running lumi checkpoint list, which should get you an output similar to this: 1234567================================================================================| id | name | alias | source | status |================================================================================| e1c2565b51e9 | Faster R-CNN w/COCO | accurate | remote | DOWNLOADED || aad6912e94d9 | SSD w/Pascal VOC | fast | remote | DOWNLOADED || cb0e5d92a854 | OpenImages Traffic | traffic | local | LOCAL |================================================================================ Moreover, if you inspect the ~/.luminoth/checkpoints/ folder, you will see that now you have a folder that corresponds to your newly created checkpoint. Inside this folder are the actual weights of the model, plus some metadata and the configuration file that was used during training. Sharing checkpointsSimply run lumi checkpoint export cb0e5d92a854. You will get a file named cb0e5d92a854.tar in your current directory, which you can easily share to somebody else. By running lumi checkpoint import cb0e5d92a854.tar, the checkpoint will be listed locally. Using Luminoth with PythonCalling Luminoth from your Python app is very straightforward. 123456789101112131415from luminoth import Detector, read_image, vis_objectsimage = read_image('traffic-image.png')# If no checkpoint specified, will assume `accurate` by default.

In MongoDB, records are documents which behave a lot like JSON objects in JavaScript. Values in documents can be looked up by their field’s key. Documents can have some fields/keys and not others, which makes Mongo extremely flexible. This is much different than SQL databases like MySQL, where fields correspond to columns in a table and individual records correspond to rows. Install and Run MongoDB with Homebrew Make sure Homebrew already installed on Mac (Homebrew is a package manager for the Mac – it makes installing most open source software). Open the Mac terminal application and type brew update, then type brew install mongodb After MongoDB is downloaded, create a directory to store MongoDB data files, type mkdir -p /data/db Make sure the directory has the right permissions: 12&gt; sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db&gt; # Enter your psd Run the Mongo daemon by typing mongod in your terminal window.

The following figure will make it clearer. StepsThe steps followed in bagging are: 1) Create Multiple DataSets Sampling is done with replacement on the original data and new datasets are formed. The new data sets can have a fraction of the columns as well as rows, which are generally hyper-parameters in a bagging model. Taking row and column fractions less than 1 helps in making robust models, less prone to overfitting. 2) Build Multiple Classifiers Classifiers are built on each data set. Generally the same classifier is modeled on each dataset and predictions are made. 3) Combine Classifiers The predictions of all the classifiers are combined using a mean, median or mode value depending on the problem at hand. The combined values are generally more robust than a single model. Note that, here the number of models built is not a hyper-parameters. Higher number of models are always better or may give similar performance than lower numbers. It can be theoretically shown that the variance of the combined predictions are reduced to 1/n (n: number of classifiers) of the original variance, under some assumptions.","categories":[{"name":"Machine-Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Bagging","slug":"Bagging","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Bagging/"},{"name":"Classifier","slug":"Classifier","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Classifier/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"What Are Ensemble Methods in Tree Based Modelling?","slug":"WhatAreEnsembleMethodsinTreeBasedModelling","date":"2018-10-10T19:33:00.000Z","updated":"2023-11-30T19:55:12.820Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/10/10/WhatAreEnsembleMethodsinTreeBasedModelling/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2018/10/10/WhatAreEnsembleMethodsinTreeBasedModelling/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroThe literary meaning of word ‘ensemble’ is group. Ensemble methods involve group of predictive models to achieve a better accuracy and model stability. Ensemble methods are known to impart supreme boost to tree based models. Bias &amp; VarianceLike every other model, a tree based model also suffers from the plague of bias and variance. Bias means, ‘how much on an average are the predicted values different from the actual value.’ Variance means, ‘how different will the predictions of the model be at the same point if different samples are taken from the same population’. You build a small tree and you will get a model with low variance and high bias. How do you manage to balance the trade off between bias and variance ? Normally, as you increase the complexity of your model, you will see a reduction in prediction error due to lower bias in the model. As you continue to make your model more complex, you end up over-fitting your model and your model will start suffering from high variance. A champion model should maintain a balance between these two types of errors. This is known as the trade-off management of bias-variance errors. Ensemble learning is one way to execute this trade off analysis.

If there is no limit set of a decision tree, it will give you 100% accuracy on training set because in the worse case it will end up making 1 leaf for each observation. Thus, preventing overfitting is pivotal while modeling a decision tree and it can be done in 2 ways: 1) Setting constraints on tree size.2) Tree pruning. Let’s discuss both of these briefly. Setting Constraints on Tree SizeThis can be done by using various parameters which are used to define a tree. First, let‘s look at the general structure of a decision tree. The parameters used for defining a tree are further explained below. The parameters described below are irrespective of tool. It is important to understand the role of parameters used in tree modeling. These parameters are available in R &amp; Python. Minimum samples for a node split 1) Defines the minimum number of samples (or observations) which are required in a node to be considered for splitting.2) Used to control over-fitting. Higher values prevent a model from learning relations which might be highly specific to the particular sample selected for a tree.3) Too high values can lead to under-fitting hence, it should be tuned using CV. Minimum samples for a terminal node (leaf) 1) Defines the minimum samples (or observations) required in a terminal node or leaf.2) Used to control over-fitting similar to min_samples_split.3) Generally lower values should be chosen for imbalanced class problems because the regions in which the minority class will be in majority will be very small. Maximum depth of tree (vertical depth) 1) The maximum depth of a tree.2) Used to control over-fitting as higher depth will allow model to learn relations very specific to a particular sample.3) Should be tuned using CV. Maximum number of terminal nodes 1) The maximum number of terminal nodes or leaves in a tree.2) Can be defined in place of max_depth. Since binary trees are created, a depth of ‘n’ would produce a maximum of 2^n leaves. Maximum features to consider for split 1) The number of features to consider while searching for a best split. These will be randomly selected.2) As a thumb-rule, square root of the total number of features works great but we should check up to 30-40% of the total number of features.3) Higher values can lead to over-fitting but depends on case to case. Tree PruningAs discussed earlier, the technique of setting constraint is a greedy-approach. In other words, it will check for the best split instantaneously and move forward until one of the specified stopping condition is reached. Let’s consider the following case when you’re driving. There are 2 lanes: 1) A lane with cars moving at 80km/h.2) A lane with trucks moving at 30km/h. At this instant, you are the yellow car and you have 2 choices: 1) Take a left and overtake the other 2 cars quickly.2) Keep moving in the present lane. Let’s analyze these choice. In the former choice, you’ll immediately overtake the car ahead and reach behind the truck and start moving at 30 km/h, looking for an opportunity to move back right. All cars originally behind you move ahead in the meanwhile. This would be the optimum choice if your objective is to maximize the distance covered in next say 10 seconds. In the later choice, you sale through at same speed, cross trucks and then overtake maybe depending on situation ahead. Greedy you! This is exactly the difference between normal decision tree &amp; pruning. A decision tree with constraints won’t see the truck ahead and adopt a greedy approach by taking a left. On the other hand if we use pruning, we in effect look at a few steps ahead and make a choice. How to prune? So we know pruning is better. But how to implement it in decision tree? The idea is simple. 1) We first make the decision tree to a large depth.2) Then we start at the bottom and start removing leaves which are giving us negative returns when compared from the top.3) Suppose a split is giving us a gain of say -10 (loss of 10) and then the next split on that gives us a gain of 20. A simple decision tree will stop at step 1 but in pruning, we will see that the overall gain is +10 and keep both leaves. Note Note that sklearn’s decision tree classifier does not currently support pruning. Advanced packages like xgboost have adopted tree pruning in their implementation. But the library rpart in R, provides a function to prune. Good for R users!","categories":[{"name":"Machine-Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Tree","slug":"Tree","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Tree/"},{"name":"Overfitting","slug":"Overfitting","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Overfitting/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"Merge Sort","slug":"MergeSort","date":"2018-05-19T04:23:47.000Z","updated":"2023-11-30T19:56:27.098Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/05/19/MergeSort/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2018/05/19/MergeSort/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroIn computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. DefinitionConceptually, a merge sort works as follows: 1) Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted). 2) Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.

This means that decision trees are typically drawn upside down such that leaves are the bottom &amp; roots are the tops (shown below). Both the trees work almost similar to each other, let’s look at the primary differences &amp; similarity between classification and regression trees: 1) Regression trees are used when dependent variable is continuous. Classification trees are used when dependent variable is categorical. 2) In case of regression tree, the value obtained by terminal nodes in the training data is the mean response of observation falling in that region. Thus, if an unseen data observation falls in that region, we’ll make its prediction with mean value. 3) In case of classification tree, the value (class) obtained by terminal node in the training data is the mode of observations falling in that region. Thus, if an unseen data observation falls in that region, we’ll make its prediction with mode value. 4) Both the trees divide the predictor space (independent variables) into distinct and non-overlapping regions. For the sake of simplicity, you can think of these regions as high dimensional boxes or boxes. 5) Both the trees follow a top-down greedy approach known as recursive binary splitting. We call it as ‘top-down’ because it begins from the top of tree when all the observations are available in a single region and successively splits the predictor space into two new branches down the tree. It is known as ‘greedy’ because, the algorithm cares (looks for best variable available) about only the current split, and not about future splits which will lead to a better tree. 6) This splitting process is continued until a user defined stopping criteria is reached. For example: we can tell the algorithm to stop once the number of observations per node becomes less than 50. 7) In both the cases, the splitting process results in fully grown trees until the stopping criteria is reached. But, the fully grown tree is likely to overfit data, leading to poor accuracy on unseen data. This bring ‘pruning’. Pruning is one of the technique used tackle overfitting.","categories":[{"name":"Machine-Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Machine-Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Machine-Learning/"},{"name":"Regression","slug":"Regression","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Regression/"},{"name":"Classification","slug":"Classification","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Classification/"}],"author":"Stephen Cheng"},{"title":"Levenshtein Distance","slug":"LevenshteinDistance","date":"2018-04-18T22:09:03.000Z","updated":"2023-11-30T19:56:31.976Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/04/18/LevenshteinDistance/","link":"","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/2018/04/18/LevenshteinDistance/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; Stephen Cheng IntroLevenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences.

It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In this technique, the population or sample are split into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on most significant splitter differentiator in input variables. ExampleSay we have a sample of 30 students with three variables: Gender (Boy/Girl), Class(IX/X) and Height (5 to 6 ft). 15 out of these 30 play cricket in leisure time. Now, we want to create a model to predict who will play cricket during leisure period? In this problem, we need to segregate students who play cricket in their leisure time based on highly significant input variable among all three. This is where decision tree helps, it will segregate the students based on all values of three variables and identify the variable, which creates the best homogeneous sets of students (which are heterogeneous to each other). In the snapshot below, you can see that variable Gender is able to identify best homogeneous sets compared to the other two variables. As mentioned above, decision tree identifies the most significant variable and its value that gives best homogeneous sets of population. Now the question which arises is, how does it identify the variable and the split? To do this, decision tree uses various algorithms, which we will shall discuss in the following section. Types of Decision TreesTypes of decision tree are based on the type of target variable we have. It can be of two types: 1) Categorical Variable Decision Tree This type of Decision Tree which has categorical target variable then it called as categorical variable decision tree. E.g., in above scenario of student problem, where the target variable was “Student will play cricket or not” i.e. YES or NO. 2) Continuous Variable Decision Tree This type of Decision Tree has continuous target variable then it is called as Continuous Variable Decision Tree. ExampleLet’s say we have a problem to predict whether a customer will pay his renewal premium with an insurance company (yes/no). Here we know that income of a customer is a significant variable but insurance company does not have income details for all customers. Now, as we know this is an important variable, then we can build a decision tree to predict customer income based on occupation, age and various other variables. In this case, we are predicting values for continuous variable. Important TerminologyLet’s look at the basic terminology used with Decision trees: 1) Root Node It represents entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets. 2) Splitting It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes. 3) Decision Node When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called decision node. 4) Leaf/Terminal Node Nodes do not split is called Leaf or Terminal node. 5) PruningWhen we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. You can say opposite process of splitting. 6) Branch/Sub-Tree A sub section of entire tree is called branch or sub-tree. 7) Parent and Child Node A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called parent node of sub-nodes where as sub-nodes are the child of parent node. These above are the terms commonly used for decision trees. As we know that every algorithm has advantages and disadvantages, below are the important factors which one should know. Advantages1) Easy to Understand Decision tree output is very easy to understand even for people from non-analytical background. It does not require any statistical knowledge to read and interpret them. Its graphical representation is very intuitive and users can easily relate their hypothesis. 2) Useful in Data Exploration Decision tree is one of the fastest way to identify most significant variables and relation between two or more variables. With the help of decision trees, we can create new variables/features that has better power to predict target variable. For example, we are working on a problem where we have information available in hundreds of variables, there decision tree will help to identify most significant variable. 3) Less Data Cleaning Required It requires less data cleaning compared to some other modeling techniques. It is not influenced by outliers and missing values to a fair degree. 4) Data Type Is Not a Constraint It can handle both numerical and categorical variables. 5) Non Parametric Method Decision tree is considered to be a non-parametric method. This means that decision trees have no assumptions about the space distribution and the classifier structure. Disadvantages1) Over Fitting Over fitting is one of the most practical difficulty for decision tree models. This problem gets solved by setting constraints on model parameters and pruning (discussed in detailed below). 2) Not Fit for Continuous Variables While working with continuous numerical variables, decision tree looses information when it categorizes variables in different categories.","categories":[{"name":"Machine-Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Tree","slug":"Tree","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Tree/"},{"name":"Decision-Tree","slug":"Decision-Tree","permalink":"https://stephen-cheng.github.io/tags/Decision-Tree/"}],"author":"Stephen
