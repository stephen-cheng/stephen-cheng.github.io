<h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p>We all know that the terminal nodes (or leaves) lies at the bottom of the decision tree. This means that decision trees are typically drawn upside down such that leaves are the bottom &amp; roots are the tops (shown below).</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steven-cheng-com/images/master/blog/2018/201805/20180506/0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Both the trees work almost similar to each other, let’s look at the primary differences &amp; similarity between classification and regression trees:</p>
<p>1) Regression trees are used when dependent variable is continuous. Classification trees are used when dependent variable is categorical.</p>
<p>2) In case of regression tree, the value obtained by terminal nodes in the training data is the mean response of observation falling in that region. Thus, if an unseen data observation falls in that region, we’ll make its prediction with mean value.</p>
<p>3) In case of classification tree, the value (class) obtained by terminal node in the training data is the mode of observations falling in that region. Thus, if an unseen data observation falls in that region, we’ll make its prediction with mode value.</p>
<p>4) Both the trees divide the predictor space (independent variables) into distinct and non-overlapping regions. For the sake of simplicity, you can think of these regions as high dimensional boxes or boxes.</p>
<p>5) Both the trees follow a top-down greedy approach known as recursive binary splitting. We call it as ‘top-down’ because it begins from the top of tree when all the observations are available in a single region and successively splits the predictor space into two new branches down the tree. It is known as ‘greedy’ because, the algorithm cares (looks for best variable available) about only the current split, and not about future splits which will lead to a better tree.</p>
<p>6) This splitting process is continued until a user defined stopping criteria is reached. For example: we can tell the algorithm to stop once the number of observations per node becomes less than 50.</p>
<p>7) In both the cases, the splitting process results in fully grown trees until the stopping criteria is reached. But, the fully grown tree is likely to overfit data, leading to poor accuracy on unseen data. This bring ‘pruning’. Pruning is one of the technique used tackle overfitting.</p>

    <p>This is an `aside`, a useful place to put information of any kind: metadata about the site author (with or without pictures), brief information about the purposes of the site, a static collection of external links or anything else.</p>
<p>For some Classless themes pictures and data about the author may suit better in the `cover` and `description` site attributes (see `config.toml`), but most of the times that kind of information will fit here better.</p>

  <footer role="contentinfo">
    <p>A default site footer. If you don't know what to place here maybe you should just write your name plus the current year?</p>
<p>If you want to have a sitemap, a contact form or other complex stuff, most Classless themes will also handle it nicely. Or you can take a look at the <code>aside.html</code> partial.</p>
